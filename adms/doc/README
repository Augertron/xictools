The html directory contains the files from the original author's
(Laurent Lemaitre) adms web site.  This site,
http://vacomp.noovela.com, seems to no longer be accessible.  These
files were copied down from an archive site: 

http://guitorri.github.io/adms.github.io/index.html

I noticed a couple of dead links, but it is basically complete.

The information is still quite relevant and is really the only
starting point for learning how to use this tool.  Prepare for a steep
learning curve, unless you are abnormally brilliant, or you are
already familiar with xml and related.

The xml directory contains all of the xml and related files from which
this release of adms is based.

Note that you can "view" the .xml files with a web browser. and see
the contents of the file documented.

The man directory contains the unix-style manual page.  This can be
copied to a man/man1 directory on your system if desired.

There are tutorials that can be found on the web for xml, xsl, xpath,
etc., which are related to adms.  See http://www.w3schools.com/xml.
