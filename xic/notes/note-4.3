----- Begin 4.3.X (Post-Production)

Changes relative to final 4.2 release (4.2.16).

Lots of small things fixed, revealed by valgrind runs.

fixed no name assignment in the Node (Net) Name Mapping panel.  Operation
would fail if names are case-insensitive (the default) and new name contained
lower case.

undoc:
avoid OA warning when opening "chip1b_top.gds nand", tries to open as
OA lib/cell.

----- switch to git code control ------

The commit notes will in large measure replace this file, at least with
respect to documenting small changes.

reversed direction of Ctrl-mouse wheel zoom, to match prevailing standard.

Porting to Fedora-25, which uses gcc-6.
Nasty problem, I have used "this" to check for a null object throughout the
program.  I.e., if (this == 0), it was assumed that one could go ahead and
do useful things without referencing the object.  This would work for simple
objects, without polymorphism.  However, calling a methon on a null object
pointer is technically undefined.  Clang would work, but emit a warning
for (this == 0), which was shut up by ((void*)this == 0).  Gcc-6 will
issue a warning even with the (void*), but allows a new local variable
to be set to this and subsequently tested.  However, it gets worse.
Gcc-6 will seg fault when calling a method through a null pointer, unless
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks is set.  So, a lot of refactoring is needed.

Begins the process of making sure that no null object pointers are
dereferenced, looks like lots of work.

__attribute__((deprecated)) can be temporarily added to a function
that tests this==0, causing the calls to emit a warning on compilation. 
The calling object can be tested at these locations.

Any method that uses this under the assumption that it may be null needs
attention, e.g. linked lists with things like
for (x = this; x; x = x->next), and the ubiquitous free function.

Remedies:
-  Make the functions static, and pass the pointer.  This is probably
   the easiest/safest approach.  But, some structs will end up with
   all or mostly static methods.  The syntax becomes a bit ugly and
   cluttered.  Did a lot of this.

- Define a macro that will test for a null pointer before a call,
  something like
#define ZCK(foo, bar, baz) (foo ? foo->bar : baz)
#define ZCK(foo, bar) if (foo) foo->bar
   Wrap calls in the macro.  Never did this, too ugly.

-  Find the method calls and add an explicit test for null pointer.
   Did a lot of this.

Fedora networking gave trouble with xic/wrspice ipc.
Set SIGIO to SIG_IGN in Xic and WRspice.  This signal is generated when a
socket status changes.  Maybe some day use this, but for now ignore them
or the program will terminate.

IPC fails if the host name can't be resolved, which was the default.
1.  In VirtualBox, make sure network mapping is set to "Bridge", default
is "NAT" which won't work.
2.  In Fedora Network setup, create a connection that uses the correct
addresses and is manual.
3.  Change the /etc/hostname file.
4.  I also changed the "hosts" in /etc/nsswitch.conf to "files dns",
not sure this was needed.

In the Spice Cmd operation, error messages weren't being handled, fixed.
This was a core leak, too.

Numerous fixes to std via handling internally.

Grid panel changed visually, new screenshot needed in help.

The Color Selection panel was changed and updated to allow setting
opposite-mode colors.  Needs new screen shot.

New environment variable XT_GUI_COMPRESS.  When set, don't allow space
around button contents.  Such space can cuase side menu button images to
be truncated on low-res displays.

The !dumpcds command will now output a GDSII layer mapping file in
addition top the tech and drf files.

Done:  Allow !join to join electrical wires.  In memory design from Cadence,
all electrical wire segments are individual wires.  Maybe a join-all-wires
command?
New !jw [-l] command.
Without arg, take the latest selected wire, and join it recursively
to other existing similar wires that share an endpoint.  With -l,
join if possible all wires on the current layer.

!select layer:
1) a hyphen ('-') is now a stand-in for the current layer, but not in
regular expressions.
2) the layer alias name (lppName) is now also tested against the regular
expression.

ToDo: std vias should be handled transparently in all CHD operations.  Vias
are ignored in display mode, compare mode (probably).
Should be DONE, perhaps a bit more checking needed.

Ctrl-click on selected standard via instance now pops up the standard
via parameter setting panel, allowing instance to be changed.  This
panel has visual changes, new screen shot needed.  Slightly different
between via creation mode (from menu) and via update mode.

Made program separable from mozy, which is gnu-tainted.
