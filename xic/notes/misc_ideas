todo:  implement same-net DRC tests.

TODO: make instance labels moveable by user in ext setup?

TODO add property to prevent merging?

TODO (maybe)
Allow "9 1 library ....", will open library b4 read

XXX Bug: "+" icon current fails for caps with .param value.

TODO:
add hash table script functions.
add an InstanceCount() script func that returns a hash table handle..
TODO: script interface to Lisp parser.

todo (maybe): handle all-angle GDSII cell placements.
gds reader would add a property to instances giving real angle.
bottom-up traversal would reparent these instances into an ortho cell with
rotated content.

Idea:
Somehow maybe make the spin operation applicable whever objects are
being placed/moved/copied?

Idea: string table, hash tab elements are kept in one big array.  Each
string is associated with an int offset into the array.  Decorate this
int with a struct with a type conversion operator to const char*, which
returns the string.  I.e., CDname is an int instead of a char* saves space
in 64-bit binaries.  Do this for other hashable objects?
todo: write a template class implementing this.

todo: report bad objects in info somehow.
fix: long text incs mod count at wrong time.

todo: make Push/Pop and Info work better with cell arrays.

todo: implement net extraction with bloat from netex file.
add vias

TODO: use hash tables in dsp_marks.cc

Long term ------
TODO: look at more complete SPICE file extraction - for exjjiv.cir for
example (.model lines retained?)
TODO: extend spice parsing to support .param, .if/.else/.endif and perhaps
model binning
