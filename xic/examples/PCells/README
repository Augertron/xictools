cappc
  A "capacitor" model.  This uses embedded native language.  The
  cell has stretch handles on each side.  The "capacitance" is shown
  in the label.

cappy
  As above, but written in Python.

captcl1
  As above, but written in Tcl, using old-style interface.

captcl2
  As above, but written in Tcl, using new interface.

spiral
  This is a native pcell version of the spiral.scr demo.  This executes
  the spiralpc.scr script, rather than saving the script in a property.

spiralpc
  Same as above, but the script is in the cell file.
