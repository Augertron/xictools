Xic Generation 4 Release Notes

This is the 4.3 post-production series.  See the release note archive
for the production releases (4.2.1 - 4.2.16) and earlier.

The 4.3 branch is the first open-source release of the XicTools.  The
programs (Xic, WRspice, and others) are available at no cost, in
binary packages for selected operating systems, and as source code.

As open-source, there may well be many different versions of the
programs available.  As much as possible, these will be consolidated
into general releases, and tagged known-good releases will be issued
periodically.  The latest source code will be available directly from
the repository, for those wishing to track the latest.

Scroll down to the notes for the current Xic release, which follows
some important general information.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT  Mac users!

The Darwin64 package release is now generated on Sierra (10.12), but
the programs are fully compatible with El Capitan (10.11).

Support for earlier OS X releases has ended.  This is Apple's
decision, not mine.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT  (Linux and OS X only)!

You MUST use the wr_install installer script to install the packages. 

This script maintains the new "SafeInstall" logic, which is described
in detail at http://wrcad.com/installer.html.  The current
installation is saved in entirety when an update is installed.  The
system is described in detail in the link, but you should know that
/usr/local/xictools/xic and /usr/local/xictools/wrspice are now
symbolic links, which point to directories where the files are
actually stored.

This has not changed since 4.2.x.

There are three ways to setup access to the programs through the shell
search path.

1.  Add the new directories /usr/local/xictools/xic/bin and
    /usr/local/xictools/wrspice/bin to the search path in your shell
    startup file.  Use the actual locations if not installed under
    /usr/local.  Be sure to use the links "xic" and "wrspice" and
    not the diretories,

2.  You can symbolically link the programs into the common
    xictools bin.  For example, go to /usr/local/xictools/bin, and
    give "ln -s ../xic/bin/* ." and similar for WRspice This only
    needs to be done once, and you won't need to change the shell
    search path.

3.  You can put shell script wrappers into /usr/local/xictools/bin
    that call the programs.  This is useful if you need to use
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH for plugins, or need to set other environment
    variables.  This is conveniently done in the wrapper.


*****************************************************
Windows Notes:

  WINDOWS USERS SHOULD DO THE FOLLOWING:
  To avoid rendering problems with tree-view display components.
  Edit the file c:/usr/local/gtk2-bundle/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
  Either comment out the line by adding a # character at the beginning,
  or replace the line with

    gtk-theme-name="MS-Windows"

  This changes the appearance of Xic and WRspice, which may look
  better to Windows users (I think so).

* DLL issues.

  As of xic-4.2.7, wrspice-4.2.4, and xt_accs-4.2.2, there should no
  longer be any DLL issues.  You should NOT have the gtk2-bundle/bin
  in your search path.

  The programs that need the bundle DLLs should be run from the .bat
  files, i.e., xic.bat, wrspice.bat, and from the accessories
  mozy.bat, xeditor.bat, and httpget.bat.  These are installed by
  default in /usr/local/xictools/bin.

  All other programs provided in the distributions can be run from the
  .exe files and don't need the gtk2-bundle.

  It is no longer necessary to install the distributions all using the
  same location prefix.  The bat files are now smart enough to figure
  out where to look in the registry.  That being said, it is still
  strongly recommended to install everything in the default location.

  Older versions of the programs had a dependence on DLLs found in
  gtk2-bundle/bin.  In particular libwinpthread-1.dll was required by
  just about everything.  The best fix is to update your programs.
  Otherwise, you need to have the needed DLLs in the search path when
  the program is run.

Cygwin users:

* Cygwin now defaults to a new "mintty" terminal emulator.  This does
  NOT work AT ALL with WRspice, or any other native Windows
  application that interacts with the console.  The same applies to
  xterm and rvxt terminal emulators compiled under Cygwin.  These work
  better for running Xic, or running WRspice from Xic, where the
  terminal window is not interactive, but there are subtle problems so
  this is not recommended.

  WRspice can be run from the old-style native bash box, or a native
  DOS box.  For example, start a Command Prompt terminal window ("DOS
  box") from Windows, and give the commands
    cd c:\cygwin\bin
    bash --login -i
  This gives the traditional Cygwin window, suitable for running
  WRspice.  This can be encapsulated in a bat file that can be run
  from an icon, there may be a c:/cygwin/Cygwin.bat file in the Cygwin
  distribution that does exactly this.  If not, create a Cygwin.bat
  file somewhere with the contents
    @echo off
    C:
    chdir C:\cygwin\bin
    bash --login -i
  This assumes that Cygwin in installed in C:\Cygwin, modify the
  file text appropriately if not.  Create a desktop icon that will
  run this bat file, and use it to launch Cygwin windows for running
  native Windows applications including WRspice and Xic.

Welcome the the first open-source release of Xic.  Now, instead of
asking Whiteley Research for new features, users can modify the source
code and do it themselves.  Please contribute!  We can help.
