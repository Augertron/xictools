wrspice-3.1.5  9/18/09

This is almost certainly the last of the "beta" releases.


Changes and New Features
------------------------

* Changes to the capacitor model.

  Capacitor models and devices now support temperature dependence
  via first and second order coefficients, similar to resistors.

  New capacitor model parameters:
    tnom        parameter measurement temperature
    tc1         first order temperature coefficient
    tc2         second order temperature coefficient

  New capacitor instance parameters:
    temp        device operating temperature
    tc1         first order temperature coefficient, overrides model.
    tc2         second order temperature coefficient, overrides model.

  The capacitance value is altered according to
    Dt = temp - tnom
    C = Cgiven*(1 + tc1*Dt + tc2*Dt*Dt)

* Changes to the Josephson junction model.

  1) The rtype=2 variation has been modified to better match the
     rtype=1 results with the same parameters.  This includes the
     intersection of the Rn projection with the axes.

  2) New model parameter "vshunt".
     If given, a linear shunt resistance will be added across all
     instances of the device.  This is in addition to the
     quasiparticle branch.  The resistance value is vshunt/Ic, where
     vshunt is the model parameter value, and Ic is the device
     (maximum) critical current.  This parameter facilitates SFQ
     circuit simulation by eliminating the separate shunt resistor.

* More unhandled HSPICE parameters added.

  Diode parameters:  tcv, tlev, tlevc
  BJT parameters:  iss, ns, tlev, tlevc, update

  These give an "unhandled HSPICE parameter" warning, unless
  ".options hspice" is given, in which case they are silently ignored. 

* BSIM3 HSPICE XW, XL parameters handled.

  The Bsim3 models (levels 7, 8, 9, 47, 49, 53) now accept the HSPICE
  xw and xl parameters.

  These modify the effective length and width, as given by the lint and
  wint parameters:

     eff_length = lint - xl/2
     eff_width  = wint - xw/2


Bugs Fixed
----------

* Fixed a bug:  Since vector scales are now carried through
  calculations (see previous release note), it is possible for a
  vector to have a scale vector from another plot.  These pointers
  were not being zeroed if the plot containing the scale was
  destroyed, which could cause segmentation faults.

  Scales are no longer carried by unit-length (scalar) vectors.

* X-Y plots were broken by the new scale handling code.  The scale
  interpolation is now skipped in X-Y plots ("vs" argument to plot
  command used).

* Really fixed marker decoloring in the Vectors and Trace tools, as
  was advertized in the previous release note.

* (Windows Only)
  Fixed the info text area in the help windows, which was not visible,
  unless the window was resized, and not properly working when visible.

* A warning message is now issued if duplicate .model lines are found
  in a deck.  "Duplicate" means that the model name (first token
  following ".model") is the same, case insensitive.  The first
  definition encountered will be taken, subsequent definitions are
  ignored.  Previously, this was silent.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-3.1.4  9/4/09


Changes and New Features
------------------------

* Update to the license validation code (Unix/Linux/OS X).

  The programs will now attempt to validate using all IP and HW
  addresses that can be determined from the machine's interfaces,
  other than the loopback interface.  Previously, at most one IP and
  one HW address were tested.  On machines with multiple interfaces,
  there could be validation problems, as the IP/HW chosen at run time
  might not be the same as assumed in the license file.

* New capability: CSDF file support.

  The Common Simulation Data Format (CSDF) is a text-mode file format
  compatible with HSPICE, Synopsys WaveView, and other programs for
  generating/plotting simulation results.

  HSPICE results can now be loaded into WRspice for display, and WRspice
  results can now be displayed in WaveView and similar programs.

  In HSPICE, ".options csdf=1" or ".options post=csdf" will generate
  CSDF post-processing output.

  The CSDF format is less expressive than the rawfile format, but will
  adequately handle common cases.

  There is no known public specification for this format, the
  implementation used files produced by HSPICE as a template.
  Please report any compatibility problems!

  The load command will automatically detect CSDF files and attempt to
  generate a plot structure, just as for rawfiles.  E.g., "load
  myckt.tr0" will load the transient analysis data, creating a "plot"
  which contains the node voltage vectors.

  For the write command, the Save Plot button in plot windows, and
  batch mode, CSDF files will be generated if the file name has the
  following extension forms:
    .csdf
    .tr[N]
    .ac[N]
    .sw[N]
  where N is an integer.  E.g., .tr0, .ac1, .sw2.  These correspond to
  transient, ac, and dc sweep results, respectively.

  In server mode (the -S command line option was given), output will
  always use rawfile format.  Otherwise, CSDF will be used if the
  extension forms above are used in the file name.

* Device instance syntax changes.

  Resistors:
    1. The instance keyword "r" now specifies resistance, and is
       synonymous with "res" and "resistance".

    2. There are new "tc1" and "tc2" resistor instance keywords.
       If given, these will override tc1/tc2 in the resistor model,
       if any.

  Capacitors:
    1. The instance keyword "c" now specifies capacitance, and is
       synonymous with "cap" and "capacitance".  This used to indicate
       current, synonymous with "i".

  These changes were for compatibility with other simulators, and
  foundry models.  For example, the following now works:

  -------------------
  * new r/c test 
 
  .subckt rxxx n1 n2 w=10u l=10u 
  r1 n1 n2 r='1.20e+03*(l-(0.0))/(w-(0.20e-06))' tc1=-1.50e-03 tc2=2.50e-06 
  c1 n1 0  c='8.00e-05*0.5*(w-(0.20e-06))*(l-(0.0))+4.80e-11*(l-(0.0))' 
  c2 n2 0  c='8.00e-05*0.5*(w-(0.20e-06))*(l-(0.0))+4.80e-11*(l-(0.0))' 
  .ends rxxx 

  xr1 1 0 rxxx l=100u
  i1 0 1 1mA
  -------------------

* Plot window and plotting capability changes.

  1) The Save button has been replaced by two new buttons:  Save Plot,
     and Save Print.  Save Plot will save the plot to a rawfile or
     CSDF file.  Save Print will save the data in the same form as
     output from the print command.

  2) The vectors will now be interpolated to the present scale in the
     plot command and similar.

  For example, suppose one has two plots, tran1 and tran2.  Tran1 was
  run in the normal "interpolate" mode, and consists of a point at
  each user time point.  Tran2 was run in "uousertp" mode, so consists
  of data points at internal time points.

  Previously, "plot tran1.v(1) tran2.v(1)" would plot funny-looking
  rubbish for the second trace, since the scale is different.  Now,
  the second trace would be interpolated to the scale of the first
  trace (which is used in the plot) before plotting, so it will be
  displayed correctly.

  Only the plot and similar plotting commands will do this
  automatically.  In other commands, or in general expressions, one
  would need to use the interpolate function to interpolate a vector
  to the current scale.

  E.g., if the current plot is tran1,
    let b = v(1) + interpolate(tran2.v(1))
  would do the right thing.  Leaving out the interpolate call would
  simply add the numbers term-by-term, padding when necessary, which
  is probably not a useful result.

* Update to the .measure capability.

  1) The "at" clause will now work correctly if there is no trigger or
     target.  E.g., ".measure tran outvar find vecname at time" now works.

  2) The "param=exxpr" clause now works.  E.g.,
     ".measure tran outvar param=expr" now works.  This is evaluated after
     all non-param measures have been done, in file order.

  3) Single-quoting can now be used in .measure lines without side
     effects.

     In WRspice, single-quoted quantities are expanded as expressions
     at circuit load time.  This is no longer done in .measure lines,
     instead a single-quoted block 'xxx' is changed to (xxx), i.e., the
     quotes are replaced by parenthenses, to prevent expansion.

     This was done for HSPICE compatibility.

  4) Vector names found in .measure lines are now automatically added
     to the save list, meaning that vectors needed for measurements
     will always be saved in the plot during analysis, and don't need
     to be explisitly included in .save lines.

* New vector primitive.

  The "function" p(src), where "src" is the name of a voltage or
  current source in the current circuit, returns the instantaneous
  power being supplied by the source.

  However, this is not a real function but more like a hard-coded
  macro that expands to "@src[p]", i.e., to the special vector parameter
  for power.  In general, as with all '@' vectors, this will not be
  available unless explicitly saved during analysis.

  If p(src) in used in .measure or "debug" lines, the vector @src[p]
  will be saved automatically.  All other uses will likely require
  explicit use of .save lines or the save command for "@src[p]".

* HSPICE parameters added.

  The MOS model parameters
    CALCACM
    SFVTFLAG
  have been added to the list of known but un-handled HSPICE parameters.

  Using ".options hspice" will silence "unknown parameter" warning
  messages.  These parameters are ignored in WRspice.

* (Unix/Linux/OS X only)

  Changed to arrow cursor in point-and-click text windows, such as the
  Vectors listing.


Bugs Fixed
----------

* (Unix/Linux/OS X)
  License validation problems on machines with multiple network
  interfaces have been fixed.

* Iplots would stop working in Monte Carlo and operating range analysis.
  Example: setup iplot, start MC analysis, iplot appears.  Delete iplot
  window, repeat MC analysis, no iplot!  Repeat MC analysis, iplot is
  back!

* It is no longer possible to initiate a normal analysis on the same
  circuit when a Monte Carlo or operating range analysis is paused. 
  This could be initiated before, but it didn't work right and screws
  up internal logic.  However, one can reload the circuit, run
  whatever analysis is required, then return to the original circuit
  and finish the paused analysis.

* The red choice indicators in the Vectors panel no longer lose color
  when the panel is updated.

* In a single-trace plot, dragging a trace in from another plot window
  will now automatically update the display to show both traces.  This
  was not automatic before.

* Fixed a bug that would cause seg faults when a plot was redrawn
  after a new trace was dragged/dropped, due to a text update
  problem.

* The "interpolate" vector math function would seg fault if used.

* Using the "plotname.vector" syntax with vectors with dissimilar
  scales could cause seg faults.  This will no longer fault, but will
  generally not produce a useful result without interpolation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-3.1.3  8/4/09

Changes and New Features
------------------------

* Sync to the current common graphics package code shared with Xic,
  which has undergone modification for Xic.  Not visible to the user,
  except for bug fixes.


Bugs Fixed
----------

* (GTK2 releases only)
  Ghost drawing, including the factor updates while the marker is
  active in plots, was not working properly.

* The i686 stack backtrace code, called on memory error, seg faults
  with gcc-4, since the stack alignment has apparently changed to 16
  bytes.  A working alternative is now in place.
  
* (GTK1 releases only)
  The search function in editor/file browser windows no longer visibly
  scrolls, it now jumps if necessary to the new location.

* The reverse search function in editor/file browser windows is now
  much faster, previously there could be a lengthly delay when
  searching up in large files.

* (Windows only)
  The menus in the text editor/file browser had inappropriate entries
  for the current mode.  The Source button in the Options menu was
  missing.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-3.1.2  6/28/09

Changes and New Features
------------------------

* Syntax extension to the plot command.

  In the plot command line, keywords that take a value can now be followed
  by an optional '=', with or without white space.  Each of the following
  examples will work:

    plot title "new title" ...
    plot title="new title" ...
    plot title = "new title" ...

  Keywords that take two values now accept a comma as a delimiter
  between the values, with or without white space.  The following
  examples all work:

    plot xlimits 1.0 9.0
    plot xlimits 1.0,9.0
    plot xlimits="1.0 9.0"

* Plot options in .options line now recognized.

  All of the plot "set" variables, if they appear in a .options line,
  will now affect plots when the circuit is the current circuit. 
  Previously, plot options set in .options would be ignored.

* Plot window change.

  The actions when clicking on the scale arrow icons in plot windows
  have been revised to provide better scale choices.

* Extended defaults for all MOS devices.

  The defl, defw, defad, and defas option variables now set the default
  length, width, drain area and source area for all MOS models. 
  Previously, these only worked with the Spice3 models (levels 1-3 and
  6).

* MS Windows Only

  The "Imlib:  jpeg, tiff, png, etc." print driver has a new feature. 
  If the word "clipboard" is entered in the File Name text area, the
  image will be composed in the Windows clipboard, so it can be pasted
  into other Windows programs.


Bugs Fixed
----------

* Fixed bug:  "set title" and other methods of setting the plot title
  didn't work, they produced a garbage string in the plot window.

* In plot windows, switching from single to multiple scale would leave
  a residual Y-scale units string in the window.

* MS Windows Only
  The "Imlib: jpeg, tiff, png, etc." print driver was not available
  due to some internal trouble.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-3.1.1  4/4/09

Changes and New Features
------------------------

* In Plot windows, in "Separate" mode, there is now a bit of space
  between trace areas, for better visibility.

  The triangle h-scale icons were moved to avoid being overwritten
  by scale factors.


Bugs Fixed
----------

* Fixed some internal timing problems with interrupt logic that would
  cause disruption of communication when running under control of Xic.

* Fixed a bug in plots which would cause the fixed marker to disappear
  or reappear when the window was refreshed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-3.1.0  2/7/09

This is the first release of the beta-test series of Generation-3
WRspice.

A draft manual is now available on the "docs" directory in the
distribution area of wrcad.com.

See the wrs3.0 file for the alpha-test series release notes.


Changes and New Features
------------------------

* New feature:  support for multiple circuits in a single file.

  Previously, when multiple files were listed on the command line in
  batch mode, or given to the source command, they would simply be
  concatenated.  It is now possible to give multiple circuits within a
  single or several files.  WRspice will source the circuits as if
  they were given individually, and similar for batch mode.  In batch
  mode, the .cache/.endcache feature can therefor be used to advantage
  without using a command script.

  New card:  .newjob

  The .newjob card is recognized in files directly read by WRspice,
  and not in files read through .include/.lib directives.  When
  encountered during a source, file parsing terminates, and lines that
  follow are taken as belonging to a new circuit deck.  The script
  execution and other operations that usually occur at the end of a
  source operation are done before parsing resumes.

  Thus, one can place multiple circuit decks in a single file,
  separated by .newjob lines.  Sourcing the file is equivalent to
  sourcing each circuit independently and sequentially.

  The line that follows a .newjob line is interpreted in exactly the
  same way as the first line of any input deck, i.e., it is
  interpreted as a circuit title line except in a few odd cases.

  If the first line of an input file is a .newjob line, it will be
  ignored, except that when reading multiple files, it indicates that
  a new circuit should start, rather than concatenation of the file
  to previous input.

  If multiple files are given to the source command, logical circuits
  are loaded sequentially, separated by .newjob lines.  These may or
  may not coincide with the physical files - lines in the files
  between .newjob lines are concatenated.

  Batch mode is similar.  A single batch job can now run multiple
  circuits.  Logical circuts are read, run, and output generated, in
  sequence.  The individual circuits can be concatenetated into a
  single file, separated with .newjob lines, or a .newjob line can be
  added to the top of the individual circuit files.  In the later
  case, "wrspice -b file1 file2 ..." would run each circuit in
  sequence.  If the .newjob lines weren't present, WRspice would
  attempt to run a concatenation of the files.

  Although circuits run in this manner are independent, note that
  variables set by scripts associated with a circuit, for example,
  would remain set for the later circuits.  Thus, there are potential
  side effects which must be considered.

  The .cache/.endcache blocks work as they would in separate files. 
  Only one cache block can appear in a circuit, but of course a file
  containing multiple circuits can contain multiple cache blocks.

  After a source of multiple circuits, the current circuit will be the
  last circuit read.

  The .newjob lines separate the input into separate groups of lines,
  so one must take care to ensure that all related .control, .verilog,
  etc.  blocks and lines will appear in the correct group.  There are
  no "common" lines.

* New/updated "plot ." feature.

  The command "plot ." extracts and plots all of the vectors found in
  in the first .plot line in the circuit that matches the present
  analysis type.  This feature has been extended:

  1) Previously, the "." had to be the first argument.  This is no
     longer true, it can now be anywhere in an argument list.

  2) The "." is replaced by the vectors from the first ".plot" line
     from the circuit file with matching analysis type.  The syntax
     has been extended so that if there are more than one .plot lines,
     those other than the first can also be used.  One can give

     plot .@N
 
     where the ".@' is literal, and N is an integer, representing the
     n'th suitable .plot line.  N is a 1-based count, with N=0 the same
     as N=1.

  3) The same syntax and analogous logic now works with the print
     command and .print lines.  The print command without arguments
     will print the previous argument list given to the print command,
     instead of prompting for input, similar to the plot command.

* Some cleanup of the compose command.

  1) Removed unimplemented log, dec keywords and updated documentation
     which incorrectly advertized them.

  2) Changed logic slightly, the start param is always first (there
     used to be provision for order reversal, but this is unnecessary).

* New option 'c' to codeblock command.

  If 'c' is given to the codeblock command, the names of the bound
  codeblocks of the currrent circuit (if any) are displayed.

* Modified .options line handling.

  The parsing and shell expansion of .option lines has been changed. 
  Multiple .option lines are parsed top-to-bottom in file order,
  left-to-right, and the result of setting each option is immediately
  available.  Thus, forms like

    .options aaa=1.0 bbb=$aaa

  now work, and as do forms like

    .options random tmpval=$&(gauss(.2,1))

  In the second example, the variable random will be set when the
  gauss function is evaluated, so it will return a random value and
  not just the mean value.

* Temporary print file deletion (Unix/Linux/OS X only).

  When a plot or page is printed, a temporary file is produced in a
  system directory (/tmp by default), and by default this file is not
  removed.  There does not appear to be a portable way to know when a
  print job is finished, or to know whether the print spooler requires
  the existence of the file to be printed after the job is queued,
  thus the default action is to not perform any cleanup.
  
  There is a new provision for deleting the temporary print files.

  New variable:  hcopyrmdelay

  If this variable is set to an integer value larger than 0, it will
  specify that a temporary print file is to be deleted this many minutes
  after creation.

  The "at" command, available on all Unix/Linux/OS X platforms (but not
  Windows) is used to schedule deletion, which will occur whether or not
  WRspice is still running.

  For this to work, the user must have permission to use "at".  See
  "man at" for more information.
  
  This variable can also be set from the "hardcopy" page in the Plot Defs
  tool from the Tools menu of the Tool Control window.

* The standard internal buffer size has been quadrupled to 2048 bytes,
  a more reasonable value for modern hardware.  The increases the
  maximum allowable command length.

* New "special" vectors.

  The following vectors are available by name in all contexts:

  @elapsed    The elapsed wall-clock time in seconds since the program
              was started.

  @space      The memory in use by the program, in bytes.


Bugs Fixed
----------

* In the compose command, if the start, stop, and step parameters were
  used to specify the data values, the composed values were wrong.

* Added some checks to avoid seg faults from incorrect parameters
  given to the compose command.

* The program could not open temporary files in some cases.

* The implicit source command would not take multiple files.  Now,
  multiple files are concatenated or otherwise processed, as in the
  explicit source command.

* The file FileSel.hlp was missing from distribution files.

* The postscript_line_draw print driver (and perhaps others) was not being
  initialized correctly, and was effectively broken.  Furthermore, the
  vertical positioning of the image on a page was not quite right, for
  all PostScript print drivers.

* Fixed the units propagation of math operators +,-,j().  If the two
  operands do no have matching types, the result vector has no type. 
  Previously, the result had the same type as the left operand.

* The shell backquote-substitution was broken, would hang the program.

* Backquote substitution within double-quotes will maintain the
  single-token aspect of the quoting.  Previously, this was not
  happening.

* Previously, it was possible to generate really strange vector names
  with the let command, for example "let aaa bbb=1" would create a
  vector named "aaa bbb".  A check now prevents white space and many
  other potentially troublesome characters from being included in
  vector names.  Odd vector names can be double-quoted in expressions
  when necessary.

* Previously, vectors created in the constants plot could not be
  removed.  This is no longer true, but the vectors created internally
  remain immutable.

* Fixed up the terminal setup, the default key mapping wasn't't right for
  GNOME (without running mapkey).

* Fixed bug:  .cache blocks with multiple lines would cause program
  crashes.
