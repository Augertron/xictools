This directory contains a collection of example WRspice input files.

This includes most if not all of the example files distributed with
Berkeley Spice3f5.

Most files will initiate analysis when sourced, the margin analysis
files will specify the initiation command that the user must type.

Many of the files user WRspice-specific constructs, and are intended
to be run in interactive mode in WRspice.  They will generally require
modification for use with other simulators, if they can be ported
at all.

The wrspice_ipc_demo.tar.gz file contains source code for building
an application which demonstrates the interprocess communication (IPC)
capablity of WRspice.  Advanced users can write programs that call
WRspice on the local or remote systems.
