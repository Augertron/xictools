Josephson Junctions Circuit Examples

Most of these files have been updated to use the MIT-LL SFQ5EE models
and other new features introduced in WRspuice-4.3.3.  Mostly they are
not backward compatible without tweaking.  There are a few new
examples here.  The previous Josephson examples have been retained in
the JJexamples_old directory.

Exceptions are mostly files that use the Ic modulation or other
extended features of the internal JJ model, these are left as-is for
now.

Not included here but highly recommended are the Xic examples
containing Josephson circuits.  This includes RSFQ libraries (regular
and inductorless) and jj/CMOS interface circuits.  Note that top-level
Xic cell files contain a WRspice listing at the end of the file.  The
cells can be read by WRspice directly, the Xic stuff is ignored. 
However, using Xic to view the schematic makes these example circuits
much easier to understand.

Some of the circuits in this directory are hopelessly opaque.
