--- Start of 4.1.X

-------- 4.1.1 released -------------
-------- 4.1.2 released -------------

Left over from 3.2:

Added named fifo feature.  Not available in Windows.  When it starts,
WRspice creates a "named pipe" in the current directory.  This looks like
a file named "wrsfifo", or wrsfifo1, wrsfifo2, etc if there are multiple
copies running.  This has the property that text written to this "file"
will be sourced into WRspice.  In particular, if you are editing a
SPICE file with your favorite text editor, you can "save" the text to this
file name, and it gets sourced into WRspice.

Fixed: dropping traces in a plot with the Marker button active would
cause the marker and button status to be opposite.

Tweeks to .global (node name) processing.  There were bugs.

roft.cir Ricardo, fix div by zero error if possible. DONE
The resistor model now prevents loading a resistance value less than
 +/- 1e-12 ohms.

Fix help sys callback to WRspice.  Import csdf files, too. DONE

New env var WRSPICE_HOME

-------- 4.1.3 released -------------

Changes related to Apple OS X release.
- Native support for tiff and ppm/pgm/pnm image formats added to help
viewer.  Previously, these formats were supported by third-party
conversion software (netpbm) which may not be around.

-------- 4.1.4 released -------------

WRspice strangeness after update, starts new fifo? FIXED

Updates to the Verilig-A system to subbort BSIM6.  A version of the
 adms-2.3.0 package
is now available from the Whiteley Research free
software repository.  This has bug-fixes, etc., and is required for
full Verilog-A capability.

The BSIM4.8.0 model has been installed as levels 17 and 59.

The BSIM6 model has been added to the adms examples, level 80.

The BSIMSOI-4.5 model has been added to the adms examples, level 81.

In DECK mode listing from listing command, long lines (defined by width
variable) are now continued using the '+' continuation method.  The 'n'
option to the listing command suppresses this.

The .TEMP line was ignored in batch mode.  Fixed, now .TEMP adds a
dummy ".option temp=xxx".

TODO: .measure fixups
  Check accommodate syntax in bsim6 ringosc_17 example.
  When measuring time, but the time value in the vector, same as its
  scale (e.g., above).

Apple packages now clear files from a previous release when updating.

The fifo is now put in the home directory.

Fixed cascade of gtk errors when WRspice tool wondiw was destroyed under
Xic control.

New boolean variable: wmfocusfix
If the user finds that the terminal window loses keyboard focus when
another window, such as a plot pops up, setting this variable may fix
the problem.  This should be set in the .wrspiceinit file, so that
if WRspice is started from a terminal window, the terminal won't lose
focus when the WRspice tool control window appears.  In some cases,
this fix may have side effects, such as causing the pop up windows
to appear below other windows, so it may not be suitable in some cases.

New variable: modpath , type list
A list of directories where WRspice will search for loadable device models
on program startup.  If not set, look in startup/devices.

New variable: nomodload, type boolean
This variable has relevance only if set in the .wrspiceinit file.  If
set, the automatic loading of device model modules will be suppressed.
This normally occurs after the .wrspiceinit file (if any) is read and
processed.  This variable is set if the -m command line option is
given.

"devload all" now will load all modules, as is normally done at startup.

The loadable module framework in now included in the Windows release.

A loadable module for the bsim6 MOS model is now included in the distribution.
This the same as can be build in the devkit examples.  In future, additional
verilog-a models will be distributed as loadable modules.

Updated to the latest release of the KLU sparse matrix solver.

-------- 4.1.5 released -------------

BUG: plot scale wrong, importing multi-d traces for MOS IV. FIXED.

BUG: overriding loadable modules fails to overwrite bsim6.
FIXED: now possible to reload a module.  There were some logic problems.

-m option changed: now have
  -m path
  -mnone
The second form suppresses auto-loading.  The now -m now takes a
argument, which is a path to either a module, or a directory containing
modules.  This implies -mnone.

The devload command can now take a directory argument, and will load
all modules in the directory.

Minimum reltol reduced to 1e-8 from 1e-5 for compatibility with
cmc qa scripts.

Updated example Verilog-A source for mextram/psp.  Added psp103.

NOTE: Local auth is much faster, when running many small sims such as for
cmc tests.

Validation speedup implemented.

Now, if --v or --vv appears with other args, the other args will be
ignored.  Previously, this was an error.

Fixed subtle bug that prevented ".ac" from being recognized as a help
keyword.

New standard option: forcegmin (boolean)
When set, this will enforce a minimim gmin conductance to ground on all
nodes in the circuit (including internal nodes of devices).  This may
facilitate convergence, etc.  This has  new check box in the Convergence
page of the Sim Defs tool.

XXX clarify cktvars variable.

Fixed bug:  AC source mag not defaulting to 1.0 (was 0.0).

Fixed bug:  The dump command printed the real val twice instead of 
real and imag for complex matrices.

Fixed bug: numerical tokens with leading '.' would crash the program
in some cases.

typing "where" (the where command) with no current circuit would crash
the program.

New "notes" feature for plots.  Used for noise analysis only for now.
A note is printed after printing, it the gain is less than the minimum.

Found/Fixed bug in bsim 4.7/4.8 that breaks noise analysis for tnoimod!=2.

New bool option dcoddstep

In ac dec analysis, with fstop/fstop < 10, will tweak the frequency
delta to his the final value, if the change would be small.  This
is mostly for cases where fstop/fstart is 2, 4, or 8 and N=10.  If
no correction, the value is 1.995 rather than 2.0, etc.  Other
simulators do this, so it is important when comparing results.

HUGE:  new boolean option extprec
When set, WRspice will use Intel's native 80-bit floating-point format
for matrix solution.

ITL4 (tran max itertions) increased to 20 (the ltra_1.cir with convolution
model and extprec set requires more iterations than the previous
10).

m parameter
bsim4 4.6.5 and later
all Verilog-A MOS devices

.options fpemode[=xxx]
now works, sets the mode during runs of the circuit.  If xxx is missing,
0 is default (as before).
There is now only one signaling mode, ahd the program will die if
triggered.  This is for GDB debugging only.
The CPU is no longer set to 64-bit mode, but to 80-bit mode.
If WRSPICE64 is set in environment, 64-bit precision will be used.

Slight change to the dynamic_gmin logic, now won't fail if there are
two successive failed trials.

Logic change:  there is no longer an attempt to reorder a singular
matrix after the first iteration at a step.  This will pretty much
always fail, stopping the simulation.  Instead, just return, and let
the driver try again with a smaller step.  This seems to be a huge
improvement.

Implemented device state backup/restore for Verilog devices, which is
used for reverting to a known-good state after convergence failure.

Added trapcheck.cir example

Fixed bug in file selection panel, the file listing window would get into
a loop adding and removing the vertical scrollbar on occasion.

New option var: delmin

New option var:  optmerge global, local, none

savecurrent deleted from plot defs, added to sim/general
several other changes to sim defs

Sim Defs -> Sim Opts, "Simulation Options" panel global change
Plot Defs -> Plot Opts, "Plot Options" panel global change

-------- 4.1.6 released -------------

adding bsimcmg to adms examples.

new real-valued option: gmax  (1e-2 - 1e12, def 1e6)
The diagonal elements of the circuit matrix will be limited to this value.
This aids convergence in some circuits - without the limiting, the
element can "blow up", causing the matrix to become singular
(the transient analysis examples for bsimcmg-1.0.7 require this).

fixed
.IC and .NODESET required the form v(xx)=val, now xx=val works too.

.measure lines now accept forms like "param'expr'", i.e., the = is left
out amd there is no white space.  For Hspice compatibility.

Change to default transient TMAX parameter.  If not given explicitly in
the .tran line/tran command, this now defaults to the smaller of
TSTEP or (TSTOP - TSTART)/50.

Previously, it defaulted to (TSTOP - TSTART)/50.

The new value produces much better looking results for circuits that
by nature take too large time steps, at the expense of simulation
time.  Some MOS ring oscillators exhibit this problem, and previous
default-parameter results could be seriously ugly unless the user set
TMAX.

        /* Old
        if (ckt->CKTmaxStep == 0) {
            if (tran->t_nocut) {
                // No timestep predicting devices in circuit,
                // set to multiple of user step.
                //
                int i = (int)(tran->t_stop/tran->t_step);
                i /= 100;
                if (!i)
                   i = 1;

        else
            tran->t_delmax = (1.001)*SPMIN(tran->t_delmax, ckt->CKTmaxStep);
*/

ITL4 back to 10, no good reason to change it making it non-standard.

.meas and .measure are now equivalent.

New options in load command: -p -cN+M

Doc this
// Consider the following script:
//     
//     title
//     .control
//     let x = 1
//     while (x < 5)
//         source circuit.cir
//         run
//         print x
//         x = x + 1
//     end
// 
// Previous behavior
//
// This will only work when started with the current plot being the
// constants plot.  The vector x is defined in the constants plot.  The
// run changes the current plot, but x is still resolved into the
// constants plot, since the constants plot is always searched.  Once a
// vector is defined in the constants plot, it can not be removed, so
// repeated runs of the script will always work.
//
// However, if the initial plot was not the constants plot, x would be
// defined in that plot, and the script would fail when x is accessed
// after the run.
//
// Current behavior
//
// Now, before executing a script, the current plot is saved in ft_plot_cx,
// which is searched after ft_plot_cur when resolving vectors.  When the   
// script ends, ft_plot_cx takes the prior value, which is zero at the top 
// level.

New plot aliases prev[N], next[N], plot[N], curplot.

-------- 4.1.7 released -------------

Fixed a bug that would crash the program under certain conditions when
the marker was used in plot windows.

Added a real parameter NOISE to resistor instances and models.  This
parameter multiplies the linear conductance used in the noise equations.
The default value is 1.0.  Probably the major use is to give NOISE=0.0
to remove a resistor from a circuit noise analysis.

DONE: use multi-d colors when plotting multi-traces with ysep.

Fixed crash in the show command when no current circuit.

New plotwin command, to pop down plot windows from scripts.
plotwin [i[d]]     will print the id number of the last plot window
                   created.
plotwin k[ill] [id] will pop down the plot with given id number, missing or
                    0 for last plot, can be a[ll] for all plots.  Negative
                    is relative to last plot id.

Big change to backquote expansion feature.  Previously, the backquoted
text was evaluated by the external shell under which WRspice is running.
Now, by default, the WRspice shell itself is used for evaluation, which
makes far more sense.  One can force the external shell evaluation by
prepending the word "shell" to the command, separated by white space.
For example:  set datevar="`shell date`"

Typing "help" without an argument would (probably) not bring up the top page,
and could cause a program hang or crash.

New setdim command.

TODO: a pwd command DONE
FIXED Bug: in Windows, the toolbar print has a problem (Segall aa.cir)

Fixed Bug: File desc not being closed, caused loop failure after about
500 sources (Segall).

-------- 4.1.8 released -------------
-------- 4.1.9 released -------------

Fixed JPL validation issue
-------- 4.1.9 re-released -------------

Make sure new users know about the tran delta timestep limiting,
and the way around using "max step" jjaccel.
Amplify this in the docs.

-------- 4.1.10 released -------------

TODO: nonlinear (func of flux) inductors. DONE

Subckt expansion peoblems for optional nodes fixed.

Avoid discontinuity at origin of tran uic output by using the computed
results after the first time point for the origin.  The origin point 
does not include the effect of device initial conditions.

-------- 4.1.11 released -------------

BUG.  Don't want to parameter expand device names.  This breaks circuits
at Northrup Grumman that have parameter names that unintentially
match device names.
FIXED
Went through and avoid things that were getting parameter expanded that
shouldn't be.  Also moved parameter expansion of the main circuit to
the subcircuit expansion module, so that expansion of lines will be consistent
in the main circuit vs. a subcircuit.

Node names
Prev:  were expanded in subcircuits but not at top level.
Now:  never expanded

Model names in .model, subcircuit names in .subckt
Prev: expanded
Now:  not expanded

Device names
Prev: expanded in subcircuits, not at top level
Now: not expanded


Bugs - double click in file selector files list starts drag. FIXED

Fixes to improve operation with multi-monitors, especially on Apple.

For device lines with optional nodes, recognition of the model token
is now right to left, which allows an optional node name to be the
same as a model name.  Not recommended.

---
In File Menu, the "Open" button is now labeled "File Select"

TODO: error messages to deck in param_expand in inpsubc.cc DONE,
messages are deferred until the parse.

in .measure, trig/targ v(x) forms now work (again).  These haven't
worked for a while, requiring tha the user give just "x" and not
v(x).

In .measure and probably elsewhere, "special" vectors in the form
@device[param] now work.  The p(device) construct, which is an
alias for @device[p] (device power for most devices) now works.

Daniel's old file latcham2final2.sp used parameterized node names.
4.1.9 gave wrong simulations since this expansion wasn't handled
properly.

new boolean variable: pexnodes
When set, nodes will be parameters expanded
For backwards compat, runs daniels deck correctly.

-------- 4.1.12 released -------------
-------- 4.1.13 released -------------

Updated adms scripts, now can support inductors.
The source letter keys are now allowed.

TODO: convert between 1 point in n dimesnions to length n, and maybe
back. DONE, setdim command
Updated the setdim command, fixed bugs.
If given without args, it prints the length and dimensions of the scale vector
of the current plot.
If the numdims equals the vector length, the vector vecomes multidim
with length 1,  the dimension number is unlimited in this case.
Following args ignored.  Such vectors plot as multi-color points.
Giving dimension 0 or 1 converts to a 1-d regular ol' vector.

In plot panel, if Points not in effect, draw line btwn points?
No, use glyph, DONE.

-------- 4.1.14 released -------------

Fixed multi-monitor problem with plot windows.

The CCVS was generating the wrong polarity output!

Fixed adms scripts so that this would work:
analog begin
  V(p,n) <+ R1*I(p,n);
  I(p,n) <+ V(p,n)/R2
end

-------- 4.1.15 released -------------

TODO: Start tutorial on C++ device module interface.

Verilog-a support updates:
The a % b operator now maps to fmod(a, b)
The following Verilog functions are now supported:
$random
$rdist_uniform
$rdist_normal
$rdist_exponential
$rdist_poisson
$rdist_chi_square
$rdist_t
$rdist_erlang

new random number generator functions
exponential(mean)
chisq(dof)
erlang(k, mean)
tdist(dof)
beta(a, b)
binomial(p, n)
poisson(mean)

-------- 4.1.16 released -------------

The fpemode=2 option now works in OS X.

The Verilog-a initial_step and final_step blocks are now recognized and dealt
with.  Inital blocks execute when MODEINITTRAN.  Final blocks execute
when time >= finalTime.

Fixed:  invocation of a function without arguments would crash the program
in some cases.  (print ogauss()).

Updated random number generators for Verilog-a.  Randomness is now gridded
at tran time steps.  Repeated runs of the same circuit will generate the
same random values unless the seed changes.

-------- 4.1.17 released -------------

Somehow Mark Jeffery's noise stuff never got into the docs.  Now an example
in tgauss descr, mentionion in .noise, reference to ASC paper, and new
noise.cir example.

tran .1p 1n was omitting final time point due to numerical problem, FIXED

-------- 4.1.18 released -------------

New section in adms/README explains how to set up tools to build
Verilog modules in Windows.

The rdist_xxx functions now accept an optional final argument, which
if given is taken as the random number time lattice spacing.  If not
given, the lattice sime spacing is set to the transient analysis
TStep.  This is completely a WRspice extension, which has significance
only in transient analysis.

long term bug: the logic for handling save/.save lines was reversed.
These were being ignored in all but .op analysis, when the reverse
is correct.

-------- 4.1.19 released -------------

no more gdb, backtrace generated internally on all platforms.

-------- 4.1.20 released -------------

Rewrote support for output from Verilog-a
Now supported: $display, $monitor
$strobe is now done correctly.

The file descriptor in fdisplay etc can be
0   output to the pop-up error window.  Previously, output from
    strobe/write went to this window.

1 or < 0
    output to the standard output (terminal window).  Output from
    display/monitor/strobe/write now goes to the terminal.

All supported Verilog system functions are documented in README.adms

new $simparam keywords
tstep
tstart
tstop
delta
delmin
delmax
abstol
reltol
chgtol
volttol
predictor

Enabled -x option in Windows, seems to work ok so not sure why it was
disabled.  It is handy for running wrspice from a mintty window.

-------- 4.1.21 released -------------

Huge new feature: multi-threading matrix loading.

new option variable: threads (integer, 0-31)
This is the number of helper threads to call on to execute device model
code in parallel.  Each should correspond to an available processor
core.  Experiment to see what works best for your machine and circuit -
more is not necessarily better.

fixed problem with multiple V()<+ contributions in a device (Andrew).

-------- 4.1.22 released -------------

More script fixes for Andrew.

The LIMITING keyword was left out of example Makefiles, all semiconductor
devices broken.
Rewrote ADMS example makefiles to to be more portable.

Fixed bug:   >& redirection would fault.
Debugging messages now participate in the "shell" redirection, mostly
to the standard error channel. Thus, run >& outfile will redirect
messages to outfile.  Previously, such messages were hard-coded to the
screen.


Lots of work trying to improve multi-threading, without much success.
Load balancing should be improved, but it doesn't seem to affect run
time.

New rusage keywords
trantstime
tranouttime
cvchktime

rusage all output now ordered nicely
new "stats" command, sorta like rusage -all

removed option keywords notrapcheck, noadjoint
new replacements: trapcheck, useadjoint
both are now off by default (for speed).

FIXME: toolbar flashes badly in Windows. DONE
Toolbar is now double-buffered.  Added percent complete annotation in
transient analysis.

-------- 4.1.23 released -------------

todo: table for qp resistance in JJ

TODO: implement "tee"

refactor for eventual multi-thread when looping.
variable noparse is gone.
Now, parse does not occur until an analysis command is given.

damn, mutual inductors are broken, again.  The loading order
is important, muts first!

two new example files jjloop.cir and jjloop1.cir.  Illustrate use of
the loop command and use of chained dc analysis.

sensitivity analysis was broken, incorrect error handling caused
program crash.

Resistor noise scaling factor was defaulting to 0.

TODO: add devcnt function/command. DONE
new command:  devcnt [ modnames ... ]
This will print the number of device instantiations for each model, found in
the current circuit.  The arguments are model names, where glob-type
wildcard characters *,? may be employed.  If no models are given,
all models will be listed.

-------- 4.1.24 released -------------

Multi-threading TODO
DC sweep chain
loop command
Monte Carlo
Op Range?

added srource device base class in device.h to provide fast access to
source info, avoiding wrapper calls in the device lib.

threads variable is gone, new variables
loadthrds
loopthrds

The .global lines were not being handled correctly.

TODO: account for dimensions in measure results in plot, so can support
threads.

the loadthrds handling now uses the generic threadpool.

-------- 4.1.25 released -------------

TODO: license file format that works only with server, allow floating
license.
This is already true!  Floeting licenses should work now.
EXCEPT How to prevent use of multiple license servers to get around
limits?

Bug fixed:  forms like PWL( 0 ... were not being parsed correctly.
The space between the ( and the first token would cause trouble.

Updated PSF capability to handle batch-mode "rawfile" output.

The --no-xshm GTK argument has not been recognized since gtk-1,2.
This is now handled explicitly, calling the deprecated gdk_set_use_xshm
function, which may or may not do anything.

Mutual inductors still broken, inductor lines must precede mut line
in file.  Fixed, order now independent as it should be.
The "k" parameter was returned as coeff*sqrt(L1*L2), now the coeff is
returned.  There is a new parameter "factor" that returns coeff*sqrt(L1*L2).
Mutuals now better support nonlinear inductors.


-------- 4.1.26 released -------------

Damn!  Muts still broken (Paul D)

-------- 4.1.27 released -------------

Bug: PSF output: everything is a branch (fixed)

control lines can now have trailing '#' comments, e.g. lines like
  alter I0, dc=0.0021             #Main JTL
now work in scripts and control blocks.  This was true a long
time ago but the capability was lost somewhere.

Fixed a bug that could crash the program when evaluating vectors.

An analysis call in an .exec block would probably crash the program.
Can't build a circuit object before text expansion.  Now, this will
fail cleanly with a message.

Fine-tuning of layout in mplot windows.

-------- 4.1.28 released -------------
