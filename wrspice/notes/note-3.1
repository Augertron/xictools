--- Start of 3.1.X

Cleanup of the compose command:
1) remove unimplemented log,dec keywords
2) change logic slightly, start is always first
3) add some checks to avoid seg faults
4) fix bug: start/stop/step spec gave wrong result

The let command can define vectors with white space in the name:
let aaa bbb=1
will define "aaa bbb".  Not sure that this is a good thing.  Commands
can (or should) accept the vector names if double-quoted.
THIS WAS CHANGED, no longer allowed.

todo: handle user-defined types better.

The codeblock print option was causing faults.
New codeblock option -c, prints bound codeblocks of cur ckt.

The program could not open temporary files in some cases.

Implicit source can not take multiple file names. FIXED

Documentation of source command updated: multiple files, flags.

*** revisit codeblock option handling, files starting with '-'? OK

dphimax limits sin source timestep? (see var descr) YES

The parsing and shell expansion of .option lines has been changed. Multiple
.option lines are parsed top-to-bottom in file order, left-to-right, and
the result of setting each option is immediately available.  Thus, forms
like
    .options aaa=1.0 bbb=$aaa
now work, and as do forms like
    .options random tmpval=$&(gauss(.2,1))
In the second example, the variable random will be set when the gauss
function is evaluated, so it will return a random value and not just the
mean value.

todo:
functions defined in .param statements should be specific to that ckt,
like shell vars.
NO.  There may not be a ckt when a function is defined.

FileSel.hlp was missing from distrib files.

FileSel - ask mode default for drag/drop? YES don't change

the postscript_line_draw driver (and perhaps others) weren't being
initialized correctly, was broken
vertical positioning wasn't right, all ps drivers.

Print - how to remove temp files?
new hcopyrmdelay variable
set to integer larger than 1, this is the delay in minutes before the
temporary file used for hard copy generation is deleted.  If this is not
set, this file (create in a system temporary directory) will not be
deleted when the printer is used.
---

fixed units calc for +,-,j()  unless both args have same units, result
as no units.  Previously, result had units of first operand.

backquote expansion didn't work, would hang program.
Check MSW!

Internal buffer size quadrupled tp 2048 bytes.

Backquote substitution within double quotes will maintain the single-token
aspect of quoting, as it should.  Previously, this was not happening.

Previously, it was possible to generate really strange vector names
with the let command, for example "let aaa bbb=1" would create a vector
named "aaa bbb".  A check now prevents white space and many other potentially
troublesome characters from being included in variable names.  Odd vector
names can be double-quoted in expressions when necessary.

Previously, vectors created in the constants plot could not be removed.
This is no longer true, but the vectors created internally remain
immutable.

----

Fixed up the terminal setup, the default values weren't right for
gnome (without mapkey).
CHECK ALL PLATFORMS!

TODO: document server operation

Fixed bug: .cache blocks with multiple lines would cause program crashes.

todo: implement multiple circuits per circuit file.  DONE

New feature:  support for multiple circuits in a single file.
New card:  .newjob
The .newjob card is recognized in files directly read by WRspice, and
not in files read through .include/.lib directives.  When encountered
during a source, file parsing terminates, and lines that follow are
are taken as belonging to a new circuit.  The script execution and
other operations the usually occur at the end of a source operation
are done before parsing resumes.

This, one can place multiple circuit decks in a single file, separated
by .newjob lines.  Sourcing the file is equivalent to sourcing each
circuit independently and sequentially.

The line that follows a .newjob line is interpreted in exactly the same
way as the first line of of any input file, i.e., it is interpreted as
a circuit title line except in a few odd cases.

If the first line of an input file is a .newjob line, it will be ignored.

If multiple files are given to the source command, logical circuits are
loaded sequentially, separated by .newjob lines.  These may or may not
coincide with the physical files - lines in the files between .newjob lines
are concatenated.

Batch mode is similar.  A single batch job can now run multiple circuits.
Logical circuts are read, run, and output generated, in sequence.
The individual circuits can be concatenetated into a single file, separated
with .newjob lines, or a .newjob line can be added to the top of the individual
circuit files.  In the later case, "wrspice -b file1 file2 ..." would run
each circuit in sequence.  If the .newjob lines weren't present, WRspice
would attempt to run a concatenation of the three files.

Although circuits run in this manner are independent, note that variables
set by scripts associated with a circuit, for example, would remain set
for the later circuits.  Thus, there are potential side effects which
must be considered.

.cache/.endcache blocks work as if they would in separate files.  Only
one cache block can appear in a circuit, but of course a file containing
multiple circuits can contain multiple cache blocks.

After a source of multiple circuits, the current circuit will be the last
circuit read.

The .newjob lines separate the input into separate groups of lines,
so one must take care to ensure that all related .control, .verilog, etc
blocks and lines will appear in the correct group.  There are no "common"
lines.

todo: print . DONE
the . can now appear anywhere among the vectors in the arg list, will
be replaced by the first .plot command args.
Also new format .@N  N is and integer, graps the n'th .plot command.
Same applies to print.  N is 1-based, 0 same as 1.

todo: how to get rusage params into vectors for time measure? DONE
New "special" vectors:
  @elapsed    program renning time seconds
  @space      program memory use

Documentation?  Before each sim run, the .execs are run (Reset called).
ditto reset command

--
print without args will print the previous expression list, user to
prompt for variable name.

---- 3.1.0 released ---

Tweeked the interrupt logic to avoid problem in portmon mode, and to
avoid segfaults if ResetControl without longjmp.

TODO: fix "separate" plots axes per ucb suggestion.  DONE
moved h scale shift icons.

fixed bug in plots: the fixed marker would disappear/reappear improperly.
---- 3.1.1 released ---

In MSW, the imlib driver was broken.
The wrong text font was being used.
New feature: if the word "clipboard" is entered in the filename entry area,
the image will be loaded into the clipboard, where it can easily be placed
in other applications.

TODO:
WRspice:
.options defl doesn't work in WRspice. same with ysep.
WRspice plot: single -> separate leaves residual "e0" string.

Fixed bug: set title and other methods of setting the title didn't work,
produced garbage string.

In the plot command line, keywords that take a value can now be followed
by an optional '=', with/wo white space.  Eg, each of the following will
work:
plot title "new title" ...
plot title="new title" ...
plot title = "new title" ...

In the plot command, keywords that take two values can now delimit the
values with a ',' with or without space. Quoting / '=' is optional.

The following all work:
plot xlimits low ho
plot xlimits low,ho
plot xlimits="low hi"

Slightly revised the actions for the plot arrow icons.  The set_scale
functions have been modified for better scale choices.

DONE
change l/w/ad/as default setting in all mos models.
the options will then work.  Default values are now set in the model code.

All of the plot "set" variables, it they appear in a .options line, will
now affect plots when the circuit is the current circuit.

---- 3.1.2 released ---

Ghost drawing in GTK2 release was not working correctly.

---- 3.1.3 released ---

Changed to arrow cursor in point-and-click text windows, such as the
Vectors listing.

New capability: Common Simulation Data Format file input/output.  These
are produced in HSPICE with, e.g.,
.options csdf=1
or .options post=csdf
The format is ASCII.  It is less expressive that the rawfile format, but
handles the simple cases.

The load command will transparently read and convert CSDF files, just as
with rawfiles.  E.g.,
load myfile.tr0

Output: write command, batch output

In server mode, file output is always rawfile.  In any other case, the
file format can be specified with a file name extension.

CSDF extensions: .csdf, .tr[N], .ac[N], .dc[N] where N is an integer.

ADD tc1/2 to resistor element.
ADD r= for device value, allow expression
similar for cap.

Resistor changes:
"r" is now keywrod for resistance, along with "res" and "resistance".
"tc1" and "tc2" are new instance keywords.  They override the model
tc1/2 if given.

Cap change:
Instance param "c" is now capacitance, along with "cap" and "capacitance".
It used to be current, same as "i".

plot panel
Save button -> Save Plot and Save Print
MSW! DONE

some problems with monte carlo:  iplot stops working,
"run" stops working.

Fixed bug:  iplots would stop working in monte carlo analysis.  Do a
mc aanalysis with iplot.  delete iplot window. do mc analysis, no iplot.
do mc analysis, iplot returns.

It is no longer possible to do an ordinary analysis on the same circuit
while a Monte Carlo or operating range analysis is in progress but paused.
This could be done before, but would not work correctly and would screw up
internal logic possibly leading to seg faults.

However, with a paused job, one can reload the circuit, do a run, return
to the previous circuit and finisn the original analysis.

---

The choice indicator in the Vectors panel no longer loses color when the
panel is updated.
Check MSW!

prelinary code to fix vector scales when plotting added.

plotting keyed text bug fixed in grid.cc

In single-trace plot, dragging a trace in will now automatically update
the display to show both traces (didn't do this before).

BUG something wrong with plot tran2.xxx in expressions.

In plot, all traces are now interpolated to the scale automatically.

Fixed bug with the interpolate function, would cause faults if used.

.measure find at  should now work.

.measure param=  should work now.

vectors names in .measure lines are now added to the save list.

single-quote expansion is no longer done in .measure lines,  these are
replaced by ( ).

two additional hspice mos model params recofnized but ignored:
CALCACM
SFVTFLAG

added p(Vsrc) pseudo-function, expands to @Vsrc[p] and returns power.
However, this will only work if @Vsrc[p] is saved (as with all device @
paeams.  But, if used in a .measure or a debug, this will be done
auomatically.

---- 3.1.4 released ---

todo:  Add temp/tc0/tc1 for capacitor instance/model. DONE

fixed decoloring in vectors, trace tools in MSW, trace tool in unix.

rewrite function in inpmodel.cc
added tcv, tlev, tlevc (diode) to unhandled list (GJC).
added iss, ns (BJT)
more, see impmodel.cc

print instance warnings once per model rather than once per instance?

p(name) should work with resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc, too.

with .options hspice, do parameter conversions (GJC).

MSW: fixed foobar label area in help windows.
------

(Herr)
Fixed a bug related to carrying scales through computations (recent feature).
If a vector was destroyed that was used as a scale, care must be taken to
zero-out these pointers.
Also, scales anre no longer carried through computations for scalars.

capacitors:
   new instance parameters: temp, tc1, tc2
   new model parameters: tnom, tc1, tc2

Bug: interpolation broke x-y plots.

JJ model changes:
1) rtype=2 model has been cleaned up to better match rtype=1 results
   with same parameters.  This includes rn projection to axes.
2) New model param vshunt.  If given, a linear shunt resistance will
be added across all instances of the device.  This is in addition to the
quasiparticle branch.  The resistance value is vshunt/Ic, where vshunt
is the model parameter value, and Ic is the device (maximum) critical
current.  This parameter facilitates SFQ circuit simulation by eliminating
the separate shunt resistor.

The scale stuff broke i-v plots.

updated the bsim3 models to handle xw, xl.
----

New warning message when duplicate .model specifications appear in the
same deck.
When this happens, the first definition is used.

---- 3.1.5 released ---
--- End of 3.1.X
