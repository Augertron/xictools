--- Start of 4.3.X

Changes relative to final 4.2 release (4.2.16).

----- switch to git code control ------

The commit notes will in large measure replace this file, at least with
respect to documenting small changes.

The default path to xic was incorrect.

Fedora port: set SIGIO to SIG_IGN, so ipc works.

Bug fixed:  In Monte Carlo analysis, compose call for checkPNTS (e.g.)
would try and delete and replace the vector, which was prevented and
a message issued since the plot active flag is set.  Instead, the existing
vector is now kept but the data array updated, in new sDataVec::reset
method.

Made program separable from gnu-tainted mozy, with HAVE_MOZY.

ToDo:  option to set default line width for trace lines in plots for
line-draw drivers (Naveen, Hypres).
DONE: Print Control Panel updated, new entry for linewidth visible
when PS line draw driver is chosen.

--- release 4.3.1

Got rid of internal pkg updates
update docs for:
XT_NO_CHECK_UPDATE
XT_UPD_DEBUG
nocheckupdate
installcmdfmt

Commands:
wrupdate -> pops up update page in help
passwd -> gone
proxy  -> gone

--- release 4.3.2

Modified adms scripts to support arrays.

updated the Verilog-A JJ model and tweaked the internal model for
consistency.

Update to gpulse tran function.  pw is now FWHM pulse width, old interp
(as variance) if given negative.  If pw is 0, SFQ pulse with pw computed from
amplitude.

Completely new DCOP calculation when JJs are present.  This is a
phase-based calculation which will find the actual initial JJ and
inductor currents.  Conventional DC analysis is now feasible with JJs.

ToDo:
Matt,

You can give commands like "plot v(1) v2) ; plot (v3) v(4)" to get two     
plot windows.  Importantly, this works from the Xic prompt line when the
plot button is active, and you can click to define the vectors.  Just add
": plot" as plain text.

I plan to add a "group" option to the WRspice plot command, so one could     
have something like "plot v(1) v(2) -g v(3) v(4) -g i(v1) i(v2)" to obtain
three sub-plots containing the listed vectors.  These would be displayed
into the same window somehow, or perhaps separate windows.  The latter case
would be equivalent to "plot v(1) v(2) ; plot v(3) v(4) ; plot i(v1) i(v2)",
which should not be too difficult to implement.

Regards,
Steve
