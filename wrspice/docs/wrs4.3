WRspice Generation 4 Release Notes

This is the 4.3 post-production series.  See the release note archive
for the production releases (4.2.1 - 4.2.16) and earlier.

The 4.3 branch is the first open-source release of the XicTools.  The
programs (Xic, WRspice, and others) are available at no cost, in
binary packages for selected operating systems, and as source code.

As open-source, there may well be many different versions of the
programs available.  As much as possible, these will be consolidated
into general releases, and tagged known-good releases will be issued
periodically.  The latest source code will be available directly from
the repository, for those wishing to track the latest.

Scroll down to the notes for the current WRspice release, which
follows some important general information.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- General changes from 4.2 branch

1.  If you currently have XicTools programs installed from earlier
branches, it is strongly recommended that these be deleted.  This will
be managed automatically by the wr_install script.  Under Windows, you
can use wr_install under Cygwin, or you can run the cleanold.bat file
before installing 4.3 programs.  You should NOT delete the gtk2-bundle
packages for Windows and OS X, these are still required for 4.3.  Your
present releases of Xic and WRspice can be saved in Safe Install
format (even under Windows), and existing safe-installs won't be
affected.

2.  The Safe Install feature now applies to all packages, including
Microsoft Windows.  In Safe Install, when updating, the current
release is saved in its entirety, and can be easily reverted to if
necessary.  The Safe Install logic is now implemented with scripts
included in the distribution files, and no longer relies on use of
wr_install.

3.  Distribution file names, and operating system names, are a little
different now.  The new OSNAME format is now in the form NAME[.ARCH],
where the optional ARCH defaults to x86_64 if not given for Linux/OS
X, or i386 for Windows.

4.2 OSNAME    Corresponding 4.3 name
Darwin64        Darwin
LinuxRHEL5      LinuxRHEL5.i686
LinuxRHEL5_64   LinuxRHEL5
LinuxRHEL6_64   LinuxRHEL6
LinuxRHEL7_64   LinuxRHEL7
Win32           Win32

4.  The XicTools source repository was migrated to GIT from CVS.  The
source tree orgainzation was improved.  The build, packaging, and
package installation systems were extensively revised.  Previously
external accessories such as adms (used with WRspice), and fastcap and
fasthenry (used with Xic) were added to the XicTools collection.  New
packages sets for Fedora26 and OpenSUSE13 were added.

5.  You probably want to remove your existing adms package, if any. 
and install the new xictools adms package.  This provides a newer adms
release, integrated automatically with WRspice.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- WRspice changes (these are the same as in 4.2.x)

The present WRspice has some differences that can affect simulation
results relative to pre-production or pre-Gen-4 releases.

1)  TMAX Limiting to TSTEP

  WRspice now limits the maximum internal time step to the printing time
  step (Tstep).  This is obtained from the tran line

  .tran Tstep Tstop [Tstart [Tmax]]     (simplified syntax)

  I.e., Tmax now defaults to Tstep.

  This was done to improve results from circuits containing only devices
  that weakly limit the time step (e.g.  MOSFETs) which otherwise can be
  ugly and wrong (e.g., ring oscillator results).  This allows users of
  such devices to get good results without having to set an explicit
  maximum time step in the tran line.

  However, if the printing time steps are very closely spaced, the
  simulation time can dramatically increase, since these points are now
  actually being calculated and not just interpolated.  The user in
  this situation has several options:

  1.  Accept the longer analysis time as the cost of greater accuracy.
  2.  Use a larger printing time increment (Tstep).
  3.  Use the Tmax parameter in the tran line to set a larger limit.
  4.  Use .options oldsteplim to use the old limit of (Tstop-Tstart)/50.

2)  Josephson Junction DC Operating Point Analysis

  The transient "uic" parameter is no longer virtually applied when
  Josephson junctions are present.  Instead, a dc operating point
  calculation is done, with Josephson junctions taken to have a very
  large conductance.  The operating range analysis is generally
  required for JJ/semiconductor hybrid circuits, but is most often
  redundant for purely Josephson circuits.

  This is all transparent to the user, except if the circuit contains
  inductor loops.  The operating point analysis, and therefor the
  transient analysis will fail in this case.  This can be remedied by
  giving the "uic" keyword explicitly in the tran command or .tran
  line, which causes the transient analysis to start with initial
  conditions and the operating point calculation is skipped.  Inductor
  loops are not a problem in this case.

3)  GMAX Resistance Limiting

  Resistor vales are limited to be larger than the reciprocal of the
  gmax parameter, which by default limits resistors to be 1 micro-ohm
  or larger.  Resistors of smaller value will be taken as the minimum
  value, and a warning message will be generated.

  Earlier releases limited the resistor values to 1 pico-ohm or
  larger, and there was no message if a resistor value was changed.

  Believe it or not, a circuit was submitted where this made a large
  difference in simulated results, unless gmax was set to the maximum
  value of 1e12.

4)  Node Name Parameter Expansion

  Node names are no longer parameter expanded (as of 4.1.12) by
  default.

  I know of at least one old deck where this feature was used.

  If the boolean variable pexnodes is set, then parameter expansion
  will occur, for backward compatibility.
*****************************************************
IMPORTANT  Mac users!

The Darwin64 package release is now generated on Sierra (10.12), but
the programs are fully compatible with El Capitan (10.11).

Support for earlier OS X releases has ended.  This is Apple's
decision, not mine.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Linux and OS X only

You should remove the following directories from your search path:
  usr/local/xictools/xic/bin
  usr/local/xictools/wrspice/bin
(assuming tools installed under /usr/local, this could be different).

These directories were required in your search path for earlier Xic
and WRspice, as part of Safe Install support.  In 4.3 releases, all
executables are linked into the
   /usr/local/xictools/bin
directory.

This directory should remain, or be added to your search path if not
already there (again /usr/local is the default, and should be replaced
by your actual installation location prefix).

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Windows notes

  WINDOWS USERS SHOULD DO THE FOLLOWING:
  To avoid rendering problems with tree-view display components.
  Edit the file c:/usr/local/gtk2-bundle/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
  Either comment out the line by adding a # character at the beginning,
  or replace the line with

    gtk-theme-name="MS-Windows"

  This changes the appearance of Xic and WRspice, which may look
  better to Windows users (I think so).

* DLL issues.

  The gtk2-bundle package must be installed to support any XicTools
  programs that use a graphical interface.  This is the same bundle as
  was used with 4.2.  You should NOT have the gtk2-bundle/bin in your
  search path, as it might then adversely affect operation of other
  programs.

  The programs that need the bundle DLLs should be run from the .bat
  files, i.e., xic.bat, wrspice.bat, and others.  These are installed
  by default in /usr/local/xictools/bin, which should be in your shell
  search path.

* Cygwin users:

  Cygwin now defaults to a new "mintty" terminal emulator.  This does
  NOT work AT ALL with WRspice, or any other native Windows
  application that interacts with the console.  The same applies to
  xterm and rvxt terminal emulators compiled under Cygwin.  These work
  better for running Xic, or running WRspice from Xic, where the
  terminal window is not interactive, but there are subtle problems so
  this is not recommended.

  WRspice can be run from the old-style native bash box, or a native
  DOS box.  For example, start a Command Prompt terminal window ("DOS
  box") from Windows, and give the commands
    cd c:\cygwin64\bin
    bash --login -i
  This gives the traditional Cygwin window, suitable for running
  WRspice.  This can be encapsulated in a bat file that can be run
  from an icon, there may be a c:/cygwin64/Cygwin.bat file in the Cygwin
  distribution that does exactly this.  If not, create a Cygwin.bat
  file somewhere with the contents
    @echo off
    C:
    chdir C:\cygwin64\bin
    bash --login -i
  This assumes that Cygwin in installed in C:\cygwin64, modify the
  file text appropriately if not.  Create a desktop icon that will
  run this bat file, and use it to launch Cygwin windows for running
  native Windows applications including WRspice and Xic.

  Note:  the 64-bit Cygwin64 is recommended over the 32-bit Cygwin,
  which suffers from internal problems due to conflicts with Windows
  Defender and other Windows programs.  This caused mysterious run-time
  failures of Cygwin programs on my Windows 10 machines.

End of general info.


===============================================================================
wrspice-4.3.3  3/6/2018
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Modified adms scripts to provide support for real-value arrays.

* Updated the Verilog-A Josephson junction model with better
  conditioned equations and better tracking with the WRspice internal
  JJ model.

* Update the the gpulse "tran" function.

  The "pw" is now interpreted as the full-width half-maximum value.
  Previously, this was the full width at peak/e, i.e., the "variance"
  of the gaussian.  If pw is given negative, it will be interpreted
  in the old way as a positive value.

  If pw is given as 0 or not given, the source now generates SFQ
  pulses with the given amplitude and computed width.  As before, if
  the amplitude is 0, output is SFQ with the amplitude computed from
  the(nonzero) pw given.  If both amplitude and pw are zero, the SFQ
  FWHM is taken as the transient analysis TSTEP, and the amplitude is
  computed.

* Completely new DC analysis capability when Josephson junctions
  are present.

  A new phase-based computation provides real operating-point and DC
  sweep analysis when Josephson junctions are present.  This is an
  important advance, which should avoid the long-standing need to use
  "uic" and ramp sources up from zero.  This also avoids the previous
  hack of using a small resistance value for JJs in OP analysis, which
  could avoid using "uic" but would cause startup transients that
  could cause non-convergence.

  For DC analysis, Josephson junctions require special treatment.
  The usual SPICE voltage-based calculation can't be used, since
  1. all (or most) node voltages are identically zero,
  2. inductors can't be shorted, since they contribute to the
     current distribution,
  3. quantum mechanical "phase" must be quantized around
     JJ/inductor loops.

  We enforce these by taking the voltage difference across JJs
  and inductors as the device phase, scaled downward by a large
  number.  The resulting device "voltages" are tiny enough to be
  negligible in comparison to "true" voltages in the circuit.
  However, one can obtain the phase, and hence JJ/inductor
  currents, by un-scaling the "voltage" and applying the formula
  for device current given phase.  This requires special
  treatment in ind/mut devices, and transmission lines with no
  serial loss (total inductance).  All other devices are treated
  normally.

  A JJ can be modeled by the basic formula i = Ic*sin(N*V).
  Inductors look like resistors, L*i = N*V*phi0/(2*pi)
  N is the scale factor, which might be 1e6 for example.

  If there are no nonzero voltage sources, then in a pure SFQ
  circuit all node voltages will be zero.  We would not need the
  scaling in this case.  Performing a DCOP would yield a
  "voltage" for each node which is equal to the phase.

  The scaling makes it possible to include voltage sources and
  resistive components in the circuit.  The small phase
  difference is assumed negligible but would cause tiny errors.
  For example, consider a current source versus a voltage source
  with series resistance.  The latter applied current would be
  reduced by the scaled phase that would appear across a biased
  junction or inductor.

  Note that for this to work, all JJs must have bias current
  less than their Ic.  Both DCOP and DC sweep analysis are
  available.

wrspice-4.3.2  10/29/2017

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* New package management system

  The existing system which automatically checks for updated packages
  has been removed, and a new package management system is available. 
  The system for sending messages to users through the wrcad.com web
  site, which was never used, has also been removed.  Presently, there
  is no internet access attempted on program startup, which saves
  time.

  The new package management page is build into the help system, so is
  available in Xic, WRspice, and in the stand-alone mozy help browser. 
  Giving the keyword/url

    :xt_pkgs

  displays a page showing the installed and available xictools
  packages.  Available packages can be downloaded and installed
  through this interface.  This can also be accessed with the
  wrupdate command.

  The following items have been removed from WRspice and the
  documentation:
    XT_NO_CHECK_UPDATE  environment variable
    XT_UPD_DEBUG        environment variable
    nocheckupdate       variable
    installcmdFmt       variable
    passwd              command
    proxy               command

  The proxy functionality has also been moved the the help system,
  through a new Set Proxy button in the Options menu of the help
  windows.

wrspice-4.3.1  10/1/2017

Welcome the the first open-source release of WRspice.  Now, instead of
asking Whiteley Research for new features, users can modify the source
code and do it themselves.  Please contribute!  We can help.

Changes are relative to the final production release wrspice-4.2.16.


CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Major refactoring due to lack of C++ standards conformance
  throughout the program, which caused real trouble with the latest
  C++ compilers.

  Specifically, it used to be possible to write very efficient
  linked-list code in C++ making use of the assumption that it is
  possible to call a method from a non-polymorphic class through a
  null pointer, and check for a null "this" pointer in the function
  body.  One could iterate over the list headed by "this" and have
  correct behavior when the list is empty.  This idiom was not
  uncommon, though it violated the official dictum that calling a
  method from a null object leads to undefined behavior.  The idiom
  was used in the Microsoft Foundation Class, for example.  Surely,
  the elegance and efficiency would obviously lead to de-facto
  standardization, right?  Alas, such code generates a warning in
  Apple's latest clang, and in addition segmentation faults in gcc-7.1
  under Fedora 26.  This code had to be replaced by static functions
  that explicitly pass an object pointer.  Uglier, more complex code,
  but it works.  This is an unfortunate step backward for "a better C
  than C" aspect of C++.

* Major effort to clean up core leaks and other internal consistency
  issues using the Valgrind analysis tool.  Lots of small things were
  fixed as a result.

* Miscellaneous changes required in port to Fedora 26, mostly in
  interprocess communication code.

* Print Control Panel updated.

  The Print Control Panel has changed.  When the PostScript Line-Draw
  driver is chosen, a new Line Width entry area becomes visible.  This
  can be used to set the line width as rendered in the plot, in points
  (1/72 in).  The default is "0", which means to use the minimum line
  width supported by the printer.

  The Portrait/Landscape selection is now a drop-down menu instead of
  radio buttons, and some controls have changed location a bit.
  
* The wrspice --v option now produces three tokens: version osname arch
  E.g., 4.3.1 LinuxRHEL7 x86_64

* Other small tweaks here and there.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* The default path to Xic was incorrect.

* In Monte Carlo analysis, the compose call for checkPNTS (e.g.)
  would try and delete and replace the vector, which was prevented and
  a message issued since the plot active flag would be set.
