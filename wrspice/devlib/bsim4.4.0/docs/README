Dear BSIM Users, 

Thank you for your support of the BSIM models. We are releasing the BSIM4.4.0 models 
today, March 4, 2004.

BSIM4.4.0 is developed to address trap-assisted tunneling and recombination current 
that occurs at reverse biased P-N junction where the doping on both sides of the 
junction is relatively high due to the halo-doping technology. The plans and progress 
of the development were presented and discussed at Compact Model Council (CMC) 
meeting in December 2003. The modification was tested by several companies 
and their feedback was incorporated into this release. 

BSIM4.4.0 has the following major feature improvements over BSIM4.3.0:  

1. A new trap-assisted tunneling and recombination current model that is applicable 
to gate-edge side-wall, STI-edge side-wall and bottom junction;

2. A new parameter VFBSDOFF introduced to improve the gate overlap tunneling current;  

3. A new parameter LINTNOI introducing an offset to the length reduction parameter(Lint)  
to improve the accuracy of the flicker noise model;  

In addition, there are ten bug fixes in this version.  The complete list of bugs and 
fixes and the users who reported them, the BSIM4.4.0 source code, BSIM4.4.0 user manual,  
BSIM4.4.0 new enhancement  document  and testing examples can  be downloaded at:

BSIM4.4.0 received intensive evaluation by TI, IBM, Renesas, Intel, Analog Device, 
Cadence. Their testing materially and substantially improved the quality  of the present 
production release. Special thank goes to Dr. Keith Green, Dr. Joe Watts, Dr. Peter Lee, 
Britt Brooks, for their guidance and technical support. We would also like to express our 
sincere thanks to all the other users who provided their input.  

We thank you for your support to BSIM and welcome your feedback on this latest version.

Sincerely,

BSIM Team
