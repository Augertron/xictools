Dear BSIM Users,

Thank you for your support of the BSIM models. We are releasing
the BSIM4.2.1 models on October 05, 2001.

BSIM4.2.1 provides bug fixes over its previous version, BSIM4.2.0. 
These bugs were discussed and approved at the September 2001 
Compact Model Council (CMC) Meetings. Some of the code is cleaned 
up to be more efficient.

Gate Induced Source Leakage (GISL) is added to give an enormous 
improvement in simulation convergence.  Together with GIDL, it makes 
the gate induced leakage component of the substrate current symmetric. 

The warning limits for effective channel length, channel width and 
gate oxide thickness are substantially decreased to avoid a large 
number of warnings when BSIM4 is used beyond its design region. For 
meaningful results, it is still recommended to keep these variables
/parameters within the BSIM4 design region.  This change is intended 
only to allow users to extend the model beyond this region with fewer 
warnings. (See chapter 1 of the manual.) 

In addition, this version adds many variables as output such as all 
the transcapacitances and some of the current components to ease the
 model verifications.

There are seven bug fixes in this version, including four which are 
in common with BSIM3. The complete list of bugs and fixes, the 
BSIM4.2.1 source code, and the model documentation can be downloaded at:

We welcome your feedback on this model.

Sincerely,

Chenming Hu
