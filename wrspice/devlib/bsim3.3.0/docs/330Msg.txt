Dear BSIM Users,
 
Thank you for your support of the BSIM models. We are releasing BSIM3v3.3.0 
version  today (July 29, 2005). 
 
Compared with BSIM3v3.2.4, the following new features are added in this version.
 
1. A Spectre thermal noise model with the noise coefficient varying smoothly 
between 4 to 8/3 when device moves from linear region to saturation region;
 
2. A BSIM4 ACNQS model that enbles the NQS effect in AC simulations;
 
3. A new parameter LINTNOI introducing an offset to the length reduction 
parameter(Lint)  to improve the accuracy of the flicker noise model;  
 
In addition, two bug fixes are implemented in this version. With the capacitance 
bug fix, the transcapacitance CGG for CAPMOD=3 is now smooth from subthreshold 
region to strong inversion with no negative value. (This bug fix has previously been 
introduced in BSIM4.5.0 beta version). 
 
The new version is backward compatible with BSIM3v3.2.4, meaning existing 
model cards may be used. 
 
BSIM3v3.3.0 source code, user manual, new enhancement document and testing 
examples can  be downloaded at: http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsim3/get.html
 
We thank TI for providing parts of the new codes and performaing evaluation for the 
new release. We thank Dr. Keith Green, Dr. David Zweidinger, Dr. Claude R. Cirba, 
Dr. Joe Watts, for their guidance and technical support. We would also like to express 
our sincere thanks to all the other users who provided their input.  
 
We thank you for your support for BSIM and welcome your feedback on this latest version 
of BSIM3.
 
Sincerely,
 
BSIM Team
