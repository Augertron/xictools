Title: List of Bugs in BSIM3v3.2.4 and Bug Fixes in BSIM3v3.3.0
=====================================================

  Xuemei (Jane) Xi, Ali M. Niknejad and Chenming Hu


  The following is a list of the bugs and code robustness improvements 
found in BSIM3v3.2.4 along with the bug fixes and improvement, which have 
been evaluated by BSIM team and the bug reporters and were approved by 
Compact Model Council (CMC) member companies (Please see "CMC's Bug 
Reporting and Resolution Procedure" attached at the bottom of this file). 

Bug 1:
------
  Reporter: Geoffrey J. Coram, Analog Device
  C files involved: b3ld.c
  C code containing the bug:
   
   capMod == 3

Proposed fix:
   define VgDP to replace  (Vgsteff - DeltaPhi),
   where,		  
		  T0 = Vgsteff - DeltaPhi - 0.001;
		  dT0_dVg = 1.0 - dDeltaPhi_dVg;
		  T1 = sqrt(T0 * T0 + Vgsteff * 0.004);
		  VgDP = 0.5 * (T0 + T1);
		  dVgDP_dVg = 0.5 * (dT0_dVg + (T0 * dT0_dVg + 0.002) / T1);                  

Bug 2:
------
  Reporter: Device EGC,  Mentor Graphics
  C files involved: b4check.c
  C code containing the bug:

        else if ((pParam->BSIM3rds0 > 0.0) && (pParam->BSIM3rds0 < 0.001))
        {   fprintf(fplog, "Warning: Rds at current temperature = %g is less than 0.001 ohm. Set to zero.\n",
                    pParam->BSIM3rds0);
            printf("Warning: Rds at current temperature = %g is less than 0.001 ohm. Set to zero.\n",
                   pParam->BSIM3rds0);
            pParam->BSIM3rds0 = 0.0;
        }


Proposed fix:

        if (pParam->BSIM3rds0 < 0.0)
        {   fprintf(fplog, "Warning: Rds at current temperature = %g is negative. Set to zero.\n",
                    pParam->BSIM3rds0);
            printf("Warning: Rds at current temperature = %g is negative. Set to zero.\n",
                   pParam->BSIM3rds0);
            pParam->BSIM3rds0 = 0.0;
        }


CMC Bug Reporting Procedure for BSIM3/4
1. User reports bug to simulator vendor.
2. Spice provider reports bug to Berkeley with recommended fix, test case and significance.
3. Berkeley will immediately post on the website with the recommended fix.
4. Berkeley will notify CMC, BSIM3/4 mailing list and FSA
5. CMC members review bug and proposed fixes
6. At the next CMC meeting the CMC will decide on what action to take on each bug. A revision
number (e.g. 3.2.1) will be assigned to the code with the accepted bug fixes.
7. Berkeley will post the list of approved bug fixes on the website along with the revision 
number assigned. Where appropriate this may include sections of revised code but Berkeley 
will not post a complete new release of the code for each minor version. For example v3.2.1 
might be specified as equivalent to v3.2 with the bug fixes posted on a particular Web page.
