The report in the postscript file UFSOI.PARAM_EVAL.ps describes
the process-based methodologies for evaluation of the UFSOI-4.5
NFD and FD model parameters. (The UFSOI-7.5 models can be 
calibrated via the methodologies described, with some adjustments.) 
It is essential that these methodologies be used. Use of more-global 
optimization methods with little link to the device structures can 
lead to nonphysical parameters which invalidate the models.
