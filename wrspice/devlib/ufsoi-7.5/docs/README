UFSOI (Ver. 7.5) / July 2003
****************************

This directory contains Type-I API code for the UFSOI-7.5 MOSFET models
(including UFPDB-2.5), glue code for UFSOI implementation in Spice3e2, 
and Spice3e2 source code including the UFSOI interface. The directory 
also contains documentation on the UFSOI models and the API interface, 
and UFSOI/Spice3e2 simulation examples. Note also the University of 
Florida COPYRIGHT statement. 

Instructions for building Spice3e2/UFSOI are in spice3e2.glue/README.
The make and configuration files contained herein were written for
compiling and building on the Solaris system at the University of
Florida (tec.ufl.edu). Minor changes (e.g., in library paths) will
have to be made for building on another system. See spice3e2/readme.solaris 
for guidance in making the needed changes.   <--------------------------------NOTE!
