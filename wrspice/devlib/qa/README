This is the top-level directory of the Compact Modeling Council (CMC)
QA system for WRspice.  This allows WRspice to run the model QA
scripts and compare results to a standard.

The lib directory contains slightly hacked CMC scripts, as provided by
the CMC.  The wrspice.pm file is the interface to WRspice, and is
hereby contributed for general use with the CMC scripts.

The files directory contains a prototype Makefile, and a configuration
file.

The user should copy make.config.sample to make,config in the same
directory, and edit make.config for the user's enviromnemt.

The other directories contain files that are provided by the model
developers, possibly hacked a bit to fit into the current framework.

We assume familiarity with the CMC scripts here, the user can find
documentation on the CMC web site.

Basically, from the lowest-level directories, type "make wrspice" to
run the tests, "make clean" to clean up.  The Makefile, and the qaSpec
file, can be edited as needed.

Output from the runs is saved in out.wrspice-xxx files.  These files
generally correspond to:

KLU  matrix solver, double precision:           out.wrspice
Sparse matrix solver, double precision:         out.wrspice-nk
KLU matrix solver, extended precision:          out.wrspice-ep
Sparse matrix solver, extended precision:       out.wrspice-nkep

The four files should be identical for a (IMHO) well-crafted model.
Naturally, they diverge markedly for some models.

There are NOTES and README files scattered around with more
information and observations.
