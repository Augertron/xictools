Dear BSIM4 Users,
 
Thank you for your support for the BSIM4 models. We are releasing BSIM4.6.5
today (Sept. 09, 2009).

Compared with BSIM4.6.4, no enhancements or modifications has been added in this version.

The only change in BSIM4.6.5 compared with BSIM4.6.4 is the implementation 
of proper Aseff/Pseff and Adeff/Pdeff dependence of the Source/Drain junction
diode currents.

For Aseff=Pseff=Adeff=Pdeff=0, the diode current becomes unphysically high 
in BSIM4.6.4, although the model prediction is valid for any positive values 
of these parameters. This is due to the fact that, if Aseff = Pseff = 0, 
(or, Adeff = Pdeff = 0) SourceSatCurrent (DrainSatCurrent) is given an 
arbitrarily high value of 1.0e-14. 

To solve this issue, SourceSatCurrent and DrainSatCurrent are individually set 
to zero in BSIM4.6.5, if Aseff = Pseff = 0 and Adeff=Pdeff=0. In addition to 
that, negative values of Aseff, Pseff, Adeff or Pdeff are not allowed. 

To summarize, if the user selects 0 or negative values for parameters here->
BSIM4sourceArea and here->BSIM4sourcePerimeter, Aseff and Pseff are set to 0 by 
the code, and thus the user can turn the diode off for source side. Similarly, 
drain side diode can be turned off by choosing non positive values of parameters 
here->BSIM4drainArea and here->BSIM4drainPerimeter. 

We welcome everyone to visit our website at:

Please refer to the bug-fix section for the changes implemented in the code.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to all the users who gave us
suggestions.
  
We thank you for your support for BSIM4 and welcome your feedback on this
latest release.
 
Sincerely,
