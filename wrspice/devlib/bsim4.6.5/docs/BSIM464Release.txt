Dear BSIM4 Users,
 
Thank you for your support for the BSIM4 models. We are releasing BSIM4.6.4
today (April 17, 2009).

Compared with BSIM4.6.3, no enhancements or modifications has been added in this version.

The following bug-fixes are the only new implementations in BSIM4.6.4. 

Bug-fixes:

1)  Uninitialized variable 'Vtm' was used.
    'Vtm' is not used, 'model->BSIM4vtm' is used instead.
	
2)  Implementation error in tempMod=3:
    Code has been modified to correctly consider tempmod=3.
	
3)  Temperature coefficients in mobMod=3 was twice updated.
    Redundant codes have been removed.
	
4)  Implementation error in thermal noise evaluation code (tnoiMod=1): 
    Code has been modified with correct mathematical operator.
	
5)  'Esat' was not updated when velocity overshoot is considered:
    Code has been modified to update 'Esat' in overshoot model.
