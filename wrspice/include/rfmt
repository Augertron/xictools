Rawfile Format

The ascii format consists of lines or sets of lines introduced by a keyword. The Title and Date lines
should be the first in the file and should occur only once. There may be any number of plots in the
file, each one beginning with the Plotname, Flags, No. Variables, No. Points, Variables, and Values
lines. Command and Option lines are optional and may occur anywhere between the Plotname and
Values lines. Note that after the Variables keyword there must be numvars "declarations" of
outputs, and after the Values keyword, there must be numpoints lines, each consisting of numvars
values. (If this is confusing just create an ascii rawfile with WRspice and look at it...) 

Line name       Description
Title           An arbitrary string describing the circuit
Date            A free-format date string
Plotname        A string describing the analysis type*
Flags           Currently, either complex or real
No. Variables   The number of variables (numvars)
No. Points      The number of points (numpoints)
Command         An arbitrary WRspice command
Option          WRspice variables
Variables       A number of variable lines (see below)
Values          A number of data lines (see below)

* See the description for the deftype command. 

Any text on a Command line is executed when the file is loaded as if it were typed as a command.
By default, WRspice puts a version command into every rawfile it creates. 

Text on a Option line is parsed as if it were the arguments to a WRspice set command. The variables
set are then available normally, except that they are read only and are associated with the plot (see
the WRspice documentation). 

A variable line looks like number name typename [ parm=value ] .... The numbers are irrelevant, the
name is the name by which this quantity will be referred to by WRspice, the typename may either a
pre-defined type or one defined with the deftype command, and the parm's are listed below.

Parameters

Name    Description

min     Minimum significant value for this output
max     Maximum significant value for this output
color   The name of a color to use for this value
scale   The name of another output to use as the scale
grid    The type of grid to use - numeric codes are:
.          0  Linear grid
.          1  Log-log grid
.          2  X-log/Y-linear grid
.          3  X-linear/Y-log grid
.          4  Polar grid
.          5  Smith grid
plot    The plotting style to use - numeric codes are:
.          0  Connected points
.          1  "Comb" style
.          2  Unconnected points
dims    The dimensions of this vector - not fully supported

If one of the flags is complex, the points look like r,i where r and i are floating point (in %e format).
Otherwise they are in %e format. Only one of real and complex should appear. 

The lines are guaranteed to be less than 80 columns wide (unless the plot title or variable names are
very long, or a large number of variable options are given), so this format is safe to mail between
systems that enforce 80 character lines. 

The binary format is similar to the ascii format in organization, except that it is not readable (strings
are NULL terminated instead of newline terminated) and the values are in the machine's double
precision floating point format instead of in ascii. This makes it much easier to read and write and
makes the file smaller. 

The circuit title, date, and analysis type name in that order are at the start of the plot, each
terminated by a NULL byte. Then the flags field (a short, which is 1 for real data and 2 for complex
data), the number of outputs, and the number of points (both integers) are present. Following this is
a list of NULL-terminated strings which are command lines. This list is terminated by an extra
NULL byte. Then come the options, which consist of the name, followed by the type and the value in
binary. The output "declarations" consist of the name, type code, flags, color, grid type, plot type,
and dimension information in that order. Next come the values, which are either doubles or pairs of
doubles in the case of complex data. 

The old format (which is used by Spice2 with the -r option) is as follows: 

Old

Field(s)          Size in Bytes

title             80
date              8
time              8
numoutputs        2
the integer 4     2
output names      8 for each output
types of output   2 for each output
node index        2 for each output
plot title        24
data              numpoints * numoutputs * 8

The data is in the form of double-precision numbers, or pairs of single-precision numbers if the data
is complex. 

The values recognized for the "types of output" fields are described in the Predefined Values table
above.
