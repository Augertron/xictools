netlist.il, modified nlPrintHeader to print ".GLOBAL" only if there
are global nets present.

Tweeked simInfo.il and WRspice.il to correctly handle the "mind"
(mutual inductor device).  The netlister was failing.

Added a "Use Initial Conditions" check box to the transient analysis
panel.  This will add "uic" to the .tran line when checked.

Reorganized the files for future export.  Will no longer supply
the analogLib, instead the user must create this with a supplied
script.
