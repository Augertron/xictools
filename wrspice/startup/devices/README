Loadable object modules found in this directory will be read into WRspice
on startup.  This will apply to all users.

Loadable module files in this directory must have one of the following
extensions, depending on the operating system:
Unix, Linux:    .so
OS X:           .dylib
Windows:        .dll

Users can load modules at startup on an individual basis by using the
devload command in their .wrspiceinit file.
