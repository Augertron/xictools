The examples in this directory were obtainied from these sources:

1) The vbs-1.3.7 release.  This is another simulator, written by Jimen
   Ching <jching@flex.com> and others.  The vbs project web site is
   www.seul.org.  The vbs code is available from www.flex.com/~jching.

   The shell script files were added.  The results can be compared to
   the vbs_output file, which contains the corresponding results
   from vbs.

   files: contrib_*, dec00?_*, expr_*, mi00?_*, stmt00?_*, wt*, x_*

   NOTE: the contrib_mem.v test taks a long time and lots of memory.

2) The "free" Verilog simulator from VeriWell.  This is a commercial
   simulator evailable as a free evaluation verion.  Do a web search
   for "veriwell" to find the current distribution point.

   files: minsim.v, sio85.v, vectors.v

   note: the sio85.v simulation seems to loop forever, or at least
   longer than my patience.

3) Unknown
   files: ripple.v, counter.v
