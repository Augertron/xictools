Scripts used to upload a new program release on wrcad.com.

refresh
  Populate the current directory (on wrcad.com) with the rest of the
  scripts.  When setting up the web distribution point, you need to
  explicitly upload the refresh script only.  Running refresh does the
  rest.  The refresh script should be run whenever one of the scripts
  changes (including itself).

upload
  This script actually does the uploading.  This uploads the
  "exported" script from the source, as well as chosen program
  distributions.  The manuals and on-line help are also updated when
  necessary.

The remaining scripts are called from refresh and/or upload, but can be
used stand-alone if necessary.  In all cases, see the comment in the
scripts for usage.
