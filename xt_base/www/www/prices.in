 Welcome to the 2016 XicTools Prices and Ordering Page</font></H2>
</center>

Products are enabled by fixed-term licensing which is ordered from
this page.  To summarize, you first obtain a key from the <b>Get A
Key</b> form.  The key identifies your installation in our database. 
The key is then used to order your license file, and future license
files, using the <b>Obtain License</b> form.  You should save your key
in a safe place.  The key and license files are provided by email,
along with a password to the program distribution repository and
instructions.  Payment can be made here by credit card.

<p>
<a href="/contact.html">Contact</a> Whiteley Research if you
have questions, or have problems with the forms on this page.

<p>
<font size=5>&bullet;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that permanent licenses, printed manuals and CDROMs are no longer
available.

<p>
<font size=5>&bullet;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing permanent licenses
will always be valid, however access to the distribution repository
after one year from purchase is limited to those who have purchased
access.  Click <a href=access.html><b>here</b></a> for more
information.

<h2><font color="#1c00cf" face="utopia">Licensing</font></h2>
</center>

Programs are enabled for use by fixed-term licensing.  There are two
types of license available: host-locked, and floating.

<dl>
<dt><font color="#1c00cf">host-locked licenses</font><dd>

These are the traditional licenses for <i>Xic</i> and <i>WRspice</i>
that have been available for many years.  They allow the program to
run on a single host, with no user limit.  Authentication can be
provided via a license server, which may be running on a different
machine, or locally without running a license server.  In the latter
mode, network connectivity is not required, so this type of license
may be desirable for laptops.

<p>
<dt><font color="#1c00cf">floating licenses</font><dd>

This type of license is new, and is available starting in 2016.  The
license must be served by the license server, the local validation
mode is not available.  The server must be run on a designated
machine, for which the licenses are prepared.  A floating license will
enable a certain number of users to run simultaneously, depending on
the number of "users" purchased.  The programs can be run on any
machine compatible with the software, and able to reach the server via
a tcp/ip network.  Once the user limit is reached, additional
authentications will fail, until one of the existing sessions
terminates.
</dl>

<p>
<b>Obtaining a key</b><br>

A key is a text code that identifies the license.  It is generated
from information about the machine to be licensed.  The key, while the
license is active, provides access to the software repository.  It is
also used to obtain the license file, and when purchasing additional time.

<p>
A key for an installation can be created from the form below.

<p>
You should keep your keys in a safe place.  You will need your keys
when extending the license.  It would be handy to keep them in a text
file so that you can cut/paste them into the license ordering form.

<p>
The key requires some information about the computer that is to
receive the installation.  The procedure is slightly different for the
various supported operating systems.  In general, you download a small
program and run it, which produces a file named "XtLicenseInfo" which
is used to generate the key.

<dl>
<dt><font color="#1c00cf">Windows</font><dd>
The programs will run on Windows 8.1 and later versions.  Obtain the
<a href="/licinfo.exe"><tt>licinfo.exe</tt></a> program, and run it on
your computer, which creates the <tt>XtLicenseInfo</tt> file.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><font color="#1c00cf">OS X</font><dd>
For OS X (10.10 Yosemite and later), click to download the <a
href="/licinfo.sh"><tt>licinfo.sh</tt></a> script.  Read the script
text for instructions:  from a terminal window, make the script
executable and run it.  This creates the <tt>XtLicenseInfo</tt> file.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><font color="#1c00cf">Linux</font><dd>
The programs are supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (or
equivalent) or later.  The <a href="/licinfo.sh"><tt>licinfo.sh</tt></a> shell
script will create a <tt>XtLicenseInfo</tt> file, as for OS X.  You
may not need to download and run this, if you know your computer's
host name and primary ethernet address.  The host name can be obtained
from the <tt>hostname</tt> command.  The HW/ethernet address can be
found from the result of running the <tt>ifconfig</tt> command.
</dl>

From the <tt>XtLicenseInfo</tt> file, one obtains the host name and
key text to enter into the form below.  For Linux, the key text is the
ethernet address, as six hex numbers separated by colons.  For OS X,
it is the machine serial number, and for Windows it is the CDROM Key.

<p>
After filling in the yellow part of the form, press <b>Submit</b>. 
Your key will be emailed to you, and also entered into the <b>Obtain
License</b> form below.

<p>
Click <a href="/keys.html">HERE</a> for additional information and
recommendations about keys and licenses.

<p>
<b>Existing Keys</b><br>
If you want to check the data on file for an existing key, enter it
into the <b>Key</b> field at the bottom of the form and click <b>Find
Existing</b>.  This will fill in the rest of the form from the Whiteley
Research database.  To change the email or contact info for an
existing key, just make needed changes and press <b>Submit</b>.

<b>Obtaining a license</b><br>
The form below can be used to order a license file, which will enable
the programs for a specified term in months.  Enter your key into the
top of the form, and the required licensing term in months on the
bottom line of the form.  For each program desired enter a number into
the <b>Nom.  Users</b> entry area.  If 0 is entered, the license will
be <b>host-locked</b>.  If a number larger than 0 is entered, the
license will be <b>floating</b>, with the simultaneous user count
limited to the number given.  If the text area contains no text, then
the corresponding program will not be licensed at all.

<p>
The cost to license each program is the base rate shown, multiplied by
the number of months, and multiplied by the number of users if the
license is floating.

<p>
Pressing <b>Continue</b> will bring up a summary and confirmation
page.

<p>
<b>Obtaining a demo</b><br>
Free one-month licenses are available, which license all products. 
Only one demo license is available per key, if you have had a demo and
wish to extend or repeat it contact Whiteley Research.  To obtain a
demo license, put "0" or "1" in the <b>Num.  Users</b> box for
<b>DEMO</b>.  If "0", the license will be host-locked, i.e., the
programs will run on the licensed host only, with no user limit, and a
license server is optional.  If "1" or any other number, the license
will be floating for a single user, i.e., a license server must be run
on the licensed host, and programs can be run from any connected
machine, but only one copy of <b>Xic/XicII/Xiv</b> and <b>WRspice</b>
can be running.  When the <b>DEMO</b> is given a value, all other
fields of the form are ignored.

<p>
<b>NOTES</b><br>
The <b>XT</b> product is equivalent to ordering <b>XIC</b> and <b>WRS</b>
separately with the same <b>Num Users</b>, but for a lower price.  You
can order floating <b>XT</b> and additional floating <b>XIC</b> or
<b>WRS</b>. but it is not possible to mix floating and fixed licenses for
a single program, or to order duplicate fixed licenses.
