This directory contains the sparse matrix solver derived from the
Sparse package from Berkeley.  The Berkeley package was used in
Spice3.

This version has been converted to c++, with numerous extensions
added, mostly in an attempt to improve performance.  Although
developed for WRspice, the package is also used in Xic.  WRspice now
uses the KLU matrix solver by default rather than Sparse, as this is
generally faster.

BE CAREFUL when modifying the files, modifications should be done
to the files here, and not the copies found in the WRspice/Xic
source trees.
