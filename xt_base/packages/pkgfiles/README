This directory is a common receiving point for the packages created
from the various tools.

Packages can be installed with the ./install command.  Type

./install

for instructions.

You can also use the wr_install script found in ../util to install
packages.  Arguments to wr_install are the actual package file names.

You very likely need to run as root to install packages.
