This directory is a common receiving point for the packages created
from the various tools.

Packages can be installed with the ./install command.  Type

./install

for instructions.

You can also use the wr_install script found in ../util to install
packages.  Arguments to wr_install are the actual package file names.

You very likely need to run as root to install packages.

XicTools Installation

If you have an existing commercial Xic or WRspice installation, i.e., one
that needs a LICENSE file, you should do the following before installing
XicTools-4.3 programs.

It is important to clear your package database of any old Whiteley Research
distributions (except for the gtk2-bundle distributions on Windows and OS X,
leave these alone, they are still required).

You have the option of saving the old programs in case you ever need
to run them again for some reason.  If you do this and use a license server,
then you will need to save your license server as well.

Windows:

From a command prompt, run the cleanup.bat script.  This will prompt whether
to save existing Xic and WRspice installations, and clear the machine of
all pre-4.3 installed XicTools packages.  This will also clear the machine
of FastHenry, FastVap, and ADMS packages from Whiteley Research.  These
are now included in the Xictools framework, with now packages available.

OS X:

From a terminal window, run the cleanup script.  This will prompt whether
to save existing Xic and WRspice installations, and clear the machine of
all pre-4.3 installed XicTools packages.

You will likely want to manually uninstall fastcap, fasthenry, and
adms if you have installed any of these from Whiteley Research source
code.  These programs are now included in the XicTools framework and
new packages are available.

Linux:

From a terminal window, run the cleanup script.  This will prompt
whether to save existing Xic and WRspice installations, and clear the
machine of all pre-4.3 installed XicTools packages.

You will likely want to manually uninstall fastcap, fasthenry, and
adms if you have installed any of these from Whiteley Research source
code.  These programs are now included in the XicTools framework and
new packages are available.
