# is for development testing only.

# First, copy some old distribution files, and the matching old
# wr_install script, to this directory.  Then ./run should proceed
# without errors.  At the end, the /usr/local/xictools should consist
# of safe-installs and an empty bin directory.

# Start by removing any 4.3 packages that may be installed.
