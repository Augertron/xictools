# The Alias line(s) implement a directory path aliasing feature for
# local file paths.  These will be applied to file paths in local URLs
# and image source paths.  For example, suppose we have
#   Alias /images /home/joeblow/pics
# If the source HTML ontains a line like
#   <img src=/images/mypic.gif ...>
# then mozy will look for the image /home/joeblow/pics/mypic.gif.  In
# general, if a local file path is prefixed with the first token of an
# Alias line, this path is internally mapped to a path where the
# second token is substituted.
