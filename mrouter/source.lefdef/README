This directory contains the source distributions for the LEF and DEF
toolkits, and documentation, as obtained from the Si2 organization. 
These are redistributed here under the terms of the covering
Apache-2.0 license.

The patch files are applied before use in the router.  The most
important change is to compile files with -fPIC, so that they can be
used in a shared library.  There are other tweaks, such as support for
Apple OS X and syntax updates for Bison-3.  View the files for more
info.
