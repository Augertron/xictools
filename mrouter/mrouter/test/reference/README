This directory contains "reference" output from MRouter.  The DEF
outputs differ in detail, see ../README.  Qrouter output is no longer
provided.  Yes, it is different from MRouter output due to several
factors.  Output from different releases of MRouter, and Qrouter, will
likely differ as well.  Presumably, all of these different wirings
extract to the same netlist and are therefor equivalent.

The output from the same release of MRouter compiled on different
machines should match, however (neglecting Windows line termination).

mrouter-(router_version)-out.lef
  The LEF regurgitation from the present MRouter release with input
  from the OSU035 LEF file.

(testname)-(router)-(router_version)[-q].def
  The routed DEF output.  The -q applies to mrouter when using
  Qrouter compatibility.

Only the "-q" version of openMSP430, needed for test2, is provided,
since these files are a bit large.
