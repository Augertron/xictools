  The top-level topic is "mrouter".

mrouter-x.x.x.pdf
  This is the MRouter manual in PDF format.  This is presently the
  only format that is installed, and provided in the binary
  distribution packages.  However, the source distribution contains
  the LaTex source, and a makefile for creating a manual in
  PostScript, HTML, and DVI formats, in addition to PDF.
