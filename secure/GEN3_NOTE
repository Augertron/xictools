The hostname in blocks is now lower case, and the test hostname is
lower cased before the MD5 comparison.

When testing blocks using MD5 checksum, if the lower-cased hostname
fails, the straight hostname is tried, so pre-Gen3 license files will
still work.

Gen3 programs/server are completely compatible with Gen2 license files
and server.

The Gen3 validate program produces license files that are NOT
COMPATIBLE with Gen2 programs/server if a hostname contains an
upper-case character.
