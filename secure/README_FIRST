This directory contains the license server and other codes and
utilities used with the commercial Xic and WRspice products.  The
current open-source releases of Xic and WRspice no longer require
licensing, and are no longer linked to this code by default.  This
code is provided here on the chance that it might be useful to someone
who needs to provide license-activated software.
