This document explains how to create a LICENSE file, needed to run
XicTools products.

1. The validate program.

   LICENSE files are generated with the validate program, which resides
   in xictools/src/secure.  This program is not built automatically,
   you must cd to that directory and type

   make validate

   if the program binary does not currently exist.

   The validate program is not intended to be installed globally, but
   an administrator can move it to an arbitrary location if desired. 
   It is stand-alone and does not access any fixed-location files.

2. Running validate.

2.1 The host name and IP address entries.

   There are some important things that need to be known in order to
   successfully create a LICENSE file.  This interface is rather
   arcane, as this program is not intended for general use.

   The licensing keys off of two data items:  the "host name" and the
   IP address.  In the simplest form, the host name is the actual
   machine name, i.e., it never includes the domain components.  On
   Unix/Linux, the "hostname" system command will print the full
   hostname.  For example:

   > hostname
   chaucer.localdomain

   In this example, the "hostname" for the validate program is
   "chaucer".

   The IP address must be a static IP address that the machine
   resolves for its own name.  It should not be the loopback address
   (127.0.0.1).

   In more complex cases, there are variations.

   a) To generate a class C license, i.e., one that will work for any
      machine in a class C range of addresses, the hostname will be
      the word
              
      any

      and the IP address will be the site's IP, with the last
      component given as 0, for example

      126.24.6.0

   b) Similarly, to generate a class B license, which will enable any
      host in a class B range, the hostname given should be

      any b

      and the IP address will be the site's IP address with the last
      two components given as 0, for example

      126.24.0.0

   c) Using the ethernet address rather than an IP address.

      There are times when it is preferable to key off of the
      machine's hardware (ethernet) address, rather than an IP
      address.  This is necessary, for example, when licensing a
      single machine and the IP address is non-static.

      In this case the hostname takes the form

      host:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

      Where the "host" is the machine name, which is followed by a
      colon (':'), which is followed by the six-component ethernet
      address.  There should be no white space, and each address
      component should be a two-character hex value, 0-padded.  For
      example

      seattle:00:30:28:c5:94:1e

      for machine name "seattle" with ethernet address "00:30:28:c5:94:1e".

      In this case the IP address *must* be a special "magic" address,
      which is

      192.168.0.1

   d) Microsoft Windows support.

      This is left undocumented for now.

2.2 The program code.

   The program to be licensed is given by a code number.  These numbers
   are listed at the top of the xictools/src/secure/secure.h file, and
   are

   SERVER_CODE         3  (for license server)
   XIV_CODE            7  (for Xiv program)
   XICII_CODE          9  (for XicII program)
   XIC_CODE            11 (for Xic program)
   XIC_DAEMON_CODE     12 (For Xic running non-graphically)
   WRSPICE_CODE        14 (for the WRspice program)

   There is an enabling hierarchy:
      The Xic code (11) will also enable Xiv (7), XicII (9), and daemon (12).
      The XicII code (9) will also enable Xiv (7).
     
   The license server is no longer itself licensed in the Generation 3
   products.

2.3 Overview and running validate.

   The LICENSE file consists of up to 64 records.  Each record enables
   a specific program on a specific host, or IP range of hosts in the
   class B/C variations.

   The validate program will prompt, on the command line, for the data
   needed for each record.  At the end of each record, the user is
   asked whether to create an additional record, or exit.

   The validate program takes no arguments under Unix/Linux.

   Below are the specific prompts that validate gives for a record.

   Program code? [0]
     Reply with the program code number from the list in 2.2 above.

   Months active? [unlimited]
     This specifies the time duration of the license, in months.  If
     you give 0 or just press Enter, there is no time limit. 
     Otherwise, give a positive number to set the termination date.

   Hostname (+/-)? [yourhost]
     Give the host name string as described in 2.1 above.  Ignore the
     "(+/-)" in the prompt, this has no current meaning.

   Internet address? [your_ip_addr]
     Give the corresonding IP address, as described in 2.1 above.

   Slave server? [n]
     This only appears when the program code is "3" (license server).
     Always give "n", or just press Enter.

   Add another block ('r' to repeat last)? [n]
     This completes the record.  Give 'y' if you need to add another
     record.  You can enter 'r' to repeat the present record, if you
     entered something wrong.  Enter 'n' or just press Enter if you're
     done.  If you give 'y' or 'r', the sequence of prompts begins
     again.

   When exiting, there may be additional prompts, like

   Code 12 user limitation? [0]
     These set the number of program instances that the license server
     will accept simultaneously.  Enter 0 or just press Enter for no
     limit.

   A log of the transactions will be written in the current directory
   in a file named "log.hostname", where "hostname" is the host name
   of the present machine.  This should be kept for documentation
   purposes.

2.4 The LICENSE file

   The LICENSE file should appear in the current directory.  This will
   be given to the end user for installation.

   The LICENSE file is a binary file of size 1536 bytes.  It can be
   corrupted by ascii-mode ftp transmission, so be sure to use binary
   mode.  If a LICENSE file has a size different than 1536 bytes, it is
   corrupt and must be replaced.

   It is not possible to "decrypt" a LICENSE file to retrieve the
   original entries.

   A license file can be tested with the lfinfo program, which, like
   the validate program, resides in xictools/src/secure.  It must be
   built in this directory by giving

   make lfinfo

   Like validate, the executable can be moved to a new location if
   desired.

   To test a LICENSE file, start the lfinfo program - it takes no
   arguments.

   The first prompt is

   Enter path to LICENSE file:
     Enter the path to the LICENSE file to test, or just "LICENSE" if the
     file is in the current directory.

   The remaining prompts are analogous to the prompts in validate.
   Here are two example sessions:

   Enter path to LICENSE file: ./LICENSE
   Enter program code [0]: 3
   Enter host [none specified]: kipling
   Enter IP address [0.0.0.0]: 192.168.1.16
   License expires: Never
   User limit: None
   Enter 'q' or ^C anytime to quit.
   Enter program code [3]: ^C

   Enter path to LICENSE file: ./LICENSE
   Enter program code [0]: 3
   Enter host [none specified]: mickeymouse
   Enter IP address [0.0.0.0]: 192.168.1.16
   Authorization check failed:
     Host mickeymouse is not licensed to run this binary.
   Enter 'q' or ^C anytime to quit.
   Enter program code [3]: ^C
