SuiteSparse is by Tim Davis, Texas A&M University

The package is available on
http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html

The current version (5/2/18) is SuiteSparse-5.2.0.  There is no
difference in the C code of the files used here, and the newer version
is larger (more Matlab things) and a little trickier to build in the
framework used here.  Thus I'll stick with the older 4.4.6 release
for now.
