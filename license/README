  included with most of the source code (.cc, .c, .h) files in the
  distribution.

  In some cases, not all provisions of the Apache license are
  available due to constraints imposed by the licensing of earlier
  work from which the file was derived.  In this case, the file will
  contain a sub-header specifying the licensing terms.
