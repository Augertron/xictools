                  XicTools Open-Source  Release
                         July 31, 2017

Whiteley Research is pleased to offer the XicTools programs:  Xic
(graphical editor) and WRspice (circuit simulator) as open-source. 
The two programs have sold commercially for more than 20 years, having
been updated steadily along the way.  However, a lot more development
is required to increase usage, and Stephen Whiteley, the author of most
of this, is ready to try a new approach.

It is expected that these programs will enjoy accelerated development
in an open-source environment, with the contributions of one and all
adding capability.  One day they may become widely used and known for
stability and available on-line support through user's and developer's
groups.  With this critical mass, the programs may become a viable
choice for foundry users, particularly those who may lack the
resources to pay for the Big Box tools.  This would never be achieved
with a proprietary software model given the limited capabilities of a
tiny company such as Whiteley Research.

The XicTools software is being releases under the Apache-2.0 license,
which is actually one of the most "free" licenses available.  One is
not restricted in using this software in a commercial environment, or
in commercial products.  There is no requirement that you must share
your source code if you use this.  The code can be redistributed with
few restrictions.  See the LICENSE-2.0.txt file for the wording of the
license.  Basically, if you are commercial and this software can add
to your bottom line, go for it, and we might even help you!

However, this software, like virtually all software, has a history. 
Much of it originalted from places like the University of California,
Berkeley (e.g., WRspice is a direct descendent of Berleley Spice). 
There are bits and pieces that come from other universities.  The
university licenses are also very unrestrictive and likely highly
compatible with the Apache-2.0 license (remember that your taxes
almost certainly paid for the software developed at the university).

At least one accessory (the help viewer) is tainted by the GNU library
license.  So, at the time of this initial release, there may be some
question as to whether the full terms of the Apache-2.0 license apply
in some cases.  This shall presumably be clarified in the future.  All
old headers have been retained, so users can make their own judgement
about the constraints on a given set of files.  Getting a beter HTML
viewer, that understands CSS, is a priority.

Incidently, the GNU licenses are an absolute scourge and should die. 
Gnu-licensed software is anything but free, its use is highly
restricted and is poison in a commercial environment.  Fortunately the
world is moving away from that nonsense, but the damage has been done. 
For years, Gnu-licensed Linux, and open-source in general, was
considered to be something far-out hippy-dippy communist, due to
"copy-lefts" and other peculiarities, by corporate IT departments. 
These people instead bought Microsoft, costing the world billions of
dollars (maybe a trillion?  who knows) as a consequence of poor
security, and need for countermeasures.  Anyway, Bill Gates owes a big
wet kiss to the GNU folks who made open-source toxic for so long.
